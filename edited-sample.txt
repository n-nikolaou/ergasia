gutenberg ebook the notebooks of leonardo da vinci complete this ebook was produced by charles aldarondo and the distributed proofreaders team the notebooks of leonardo da vinci volume translated by jean paul richter preface a singular fatality has ruled the destiny of nearly all the most famous of leonardo da vinci s works two of the three most important were never completed obstacles having arisen during his life time which obliged him to leave them unfinished namely the sforza monument and the wall painting of the battle of anghiari while the third the picture of the last supper at milan has suffered irremediable injury from decay and the repeated restorations to which it was recklessly subjected during the xviith and xviiith centuries nevertheless no other picture of the renaissance has become so wellknown and popular through copies of every description vasari says and rightly in his life of leonardo that he laboured much more by his word than in fact or by deed and the biographer evidently had in his mind the numerous works in manuscript which have been preserved to this day to us now it seems almost inexplicable that these valuable and interesting original texts should have remained so long unpublished and indeed forgotten it is certain that during the xvith and xviith centuries their exceptional value was highly appreciated this is proved not merely by the prices which they commanded but also by the exceptional interest which has been attached to the change of ownership of merely a few pages of manuscript that notwithstanding this eagerness to possess the manuscripts their contents remained a mystery can only be accounted for by the many and great difficulties attending the task of deciphering them the handwriting is so peculiar that it requires considerable practice to read even a few detached phrases much more to solve with any certainty the numerous difficulties of alternative readings and to master the sense as a connected whole vasari observes with reference to leonardos writing he wrote backwards in rude characters and with the left hand so that any one who is not practised in reading them cannot understand them the aid of a mirror in reading reversed handwriting appears to me available only for a first experimental reading speaking from my own experience the persistent use of it is too fatiguing and inconvenient to be practically advisable considering the enormous mass of manuscripts to be deciphered and as after all leonardo s handwriting runs backwards just as all oriental character runs backwards that is to say from right to left the difficulty of reading direct from the writing is not insuperable this obvious peculiarity in the writing is not however by any means the only obstacle in the way of mastering the text leonardo made use of an orthography peculiar to himself he had a fashion of amalgamating several short words into one long one or again he would quite arbitrarily divide a long word into two separate halves added to this there is no punctuation whatever to regulate the division and construction of the sentences nor are there any accents and the reader may imagine that such difficulties were almost sufficient to make the task seem a desperate one to a beginner it is therefore not surprising that the good intentions of some of leonardo s most reverent admirers should have failed leonardos literary labours in various departments both of art and of science were those essentially of an enquirer hence the analytical method is that which he employs in arguing out his investigations and dissertations the vast structure of his scientific theories is consequently built up of numerous separate researches and it is much to be lamented that he should never have collated and arranged them his love for detailed research as it seems to me was the reason that in almost all the manuscripts the different paragraphs appear to us to be in utter confusion on one and the same page observations on the most dissimilar subjects follow each other without any connection a page for instance will begin with some principles of astronomy or the motion of the earth then come the laws of sound and finally some precepts as to colour another page will begin with his investigations on the structure of the intestines and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations of poetry to painting and so forth leonardo himself lamented this confusion and for that reason i do not think that the publication of the texts in the order in which they occur in the originals would at all fulfil his intentions no reader could find his way through such a labyrinth leonardo himself could not have done it added to this more than half of the five thousand manuscript pages which now remain to us are written on loose leaves and at present arranged in a manner which has no justification beyond the fancy of the collector who first brought them together to make volumes of more or less extent nay even in the volumes the pages of which were numbered by leonardo himself their order so far as the connection of the texts was concerned was obviously a matter of indifference to him the only point he seems to have kept in view when first writing down his notes was that each observation should be complete to the end on the page on which it was begun the exceptions to this rule are extremely few and it is certainly noteworthy that we find in such cases in bound volumes with his numbered pages the written observations turn over this is the continuation of the previous page and the like is not this sufficient to prove that it was only in quite exceptional cases that the writer intended the consecutive pages to remain connected when he should at last carry out the often planned arrangement of his writings what this final arrangement was to be leonardo has in most cases indicated with considerable completeness in other cases this authoritative clue is wanting but the difficulties arising from this are not insuperable for as the subject of the separate paragraphs is always distinct and well defined in itself it is quite possible to construct a well planned whole out of the scattered materials of his scientific system and i may venture to state that i have devoted especial care and thought to the due execution of this responsible task the beginning of leonardo s literary labours dates from about his thirty seventh year and he seems to have carried them on without any serious interruption till his death thus the manuscripts that remain represent a period of about thirty years within this space of time his handwriting altered so little that it is impossible to judge from it of the date of any particular text the exact dates indeed can only be assigned to certain note books in which the year is incidentally indicated and in which the order of the leaves has not been altered since leonardo used them the assistance these afford for a chronological arrangement of the manuscripts is generally self evident by this clue i have assigned to the original manuscripts now scattered through england italy and france the order of their production as in many matters of detail it is highly important to be able to verify the time and place at which certain observations were made and registered for this purpose the bibliography of the manuscripts given at the end of vol ii may be regarded as an index not far short of complete of all leonardo s literary works now extant the consecutive numbers from to at the head of each passage in this work indicate their logical sequence with reference to the subjects while the letters and figures to the left of each paragraph refer to the original manuscript and number of the page on which that particular passage is to be found thus the reader by referring to the list of manuscripts at the beginning of volume i and to the bibliography at the end of volume ii can in every instance easily ascertain not merely the period to which the passage belongs but also exactly where it stood in the original document thus too by following the sequence of the numbers in the bibliographical index the reader may reconstruct the original order of the manuscripts and recompose the various texts to be found on the original sheets so much of it that is to say as by its subject matter came within the scope of this work it may however be here observed that leonardo s manuscripts contain besides the passages here printed a great number of notes and dissertations on mechanics physics and some other subjects many of which could only be satisfactorily dealt with by specialists i have given as complete a review of these writings as seemed necessary in the bibliographical notes in raphael trichet dufresne of paris published a selection from leonardo s writings on painting and this treatise became so popular that it has since been reprinted about two and twenty times and in six different languages but none of these editions were derived from the original texts which were supposed to have been lost but from early copies in which leonardo s text had been more or less mutilated and which were all fragmentary the oldest and on the whole the best copy of leonardo s essays and precepts on painting is in the vatican library this has been twice printed first by manzi in and secondly by ludwig in still this ancient copy and the published editions of it contain much for which it would be rash to hold leonardo responsible and some portions such as the very important rules for the proportions of the human figure are wholly wanting on the other hand they contain passages which if they are genuine cannot now be verified from any original manuscript extant these copies at any rate neither give us the original order of the texts as written by leonardo nor do they afford any substitute by connecting them on a rational scheme indeed in their chaotic confusion they are anything rather than satisfactory reading the fault no doubt rests with the compiler of the vatican copy which would seem to be the source whence all the published and extensively known texts were derived for instead of arranging the passages himself he was satisfied with recording a suggestion for a final arrangement of them into eight distinct parts without attempting to carry out his scheme under the mistaken idea that this plan of distribution might be that not of the compiler but of leonardo himself the various editors down to the present day have very injudiciously continued to adopt this order or rather disorder i like other enquirers had given up the original manuscript of the trattato della pittura for lost till in the beginning of i was enabled by the liberality of lord ashburnham to inspect his manuscripts and was so happy as to discover among them the original text of the best known portion of the trattato in his magnificent library at ashburnham place though this discovery was of a fragment only but a considerable fragment inciting me to further search it gave the key to the mystery which had so long enveloped the first origin of all the known copies of the trattato the extensive researches i was subsequently enabled to prosecute and the results of which are combined in this work were only rendered possible by the unrestricted permission granted me to investigate all the manuscripts by leonardo dispersed throughout europe and to reproduce the highly important original sketches they contain by the process of photogravure her majesty the queen graciously accorded me special permission to copy for publication the manuscripts at the royal library at windsor the commission centrale administrative de l institut de france paris gave me in the most liberal manner in answer to an application from sir frederic leighton p r a corresponding member of the institut free permission to work for several months in their private collection at deciphering the manuscripts preserved there the same favour which lord ashburnham had already granted me was extended to me by the earl of leicester the marchese trivulsi and the curators of the ambrosian library at milan by the conte manzoni at rome and by other private owners of manuscripts of leonardo s as also by the directors of the louvre at paris the accademia at venice the uffizi at florence the royal library at turin and the british museum and the south kensington museum i am also greatly indebted to the librarians of these various collections for much assistance in my labours and more particularly to monsieur louis lalanne of the institut de france the abbate ceriani of the ambrosian library mr maude thompson keeper of manuscripts at the british museum mr holmes the queens librarian at windsor the revd vere bayne librarian of christ church college at oxford and the revd a napier librarian to the earl of leicester at holkham hall in correcting the italian text for the press i have had the advantage of valuable advice from the commendatore giov morelli senatore del regno and from signor gustavo frizzoni of milan the translation under many difficulties of the italian text into english is mainly due to mrs r c bell while the rendering of several of the most puzzling and important passages particularly in the second half of vol i i owe to the indefatigable interest taken in this work by mr e j poynter r a finally i must express my thanks to mr alfred marks of long ditton who has most kindly assisted me throughout in the revision of the proof sheets the notes and dissertations on the texts on architecture in vol ii i owe to my friend baron henri de geymuller of paris i may further mention with regard to the illustrations that the negatives for the production of the photo gravures by monsieur dujardin of paris were all taken direct from the originals it is scarcely necessary to add that most of the drawings here reproduced in facsimile have never been published before as i am now on the termination of a work of several years duration in a position to review the general tenour of leonardos writings i may perhaps be permitted to add a word as to my own estimate of the value of their contents i have already shown that it is due to nothing but a fortuitous succession of unfortunate circumstances that we should not long since have known leonardo not merely as a painter but as an author a philosopher and a naturalist there can be no doubt that in more than one department his principles and discoveries were infinitely more in accord with the teachings of modern science than with the views of his contemporaries for this reason his extraordinary gifts and merits are far more likely to be appreciated in our own time than they could have been during the preceding centuries he has been unjustly accused of having squandered his powers by beginning a variety of studies and then having hardly begun throwing them aside the truth is that the labours of three centuries have hardly sufficed for the elucidation of some of the problems which occupied his mighty mind alexander von humboldt has borne witness that he was the first to start on the road towards the point where all the impressions of our senses converge in the idea of the unity of nature nay yet more may be said the very words which are inscribed on the monument of alexander von humboldt himself at berlin

under water and how and wherefore i do not describe my method of remaining under water and how long i can remain without eating and i do not publish nor divulge these by reason of the evil nature of men who would use them for assassinations at the bottom of the sea by destroying ships and sinking them together with the men in them nevertheless i will impart others which are not dangerous because the mouth of the tube through which you breathe is above the water supported on air sacks or cork footnote the leaf on which this passage is written is headed with the words casi and most of these cases begin with the word come like the two here given which are the th and th sughero in the codex antlanticus a a there is a sketch drawn with the pen representing a man with a tube in his mouth and at the farther end of the tube a disk by the tube the word channa is written and by the disk the word sughero the preparation of the mss for publication when you put together the science of the motions of water remember to include under each proposition its application and use in order that this science may not be useless footnote a comparatively small portion of leonardo s notes on water power was published at bologna in under the title del moto e misura dell acqua di l da vinci admonition to readers let no man who is not a mathematician read the elements of my work the disorder in the mss begun at florence in the house of piero di braccio martelli on the nd day of march and this is to be a collection without order taken from many papers which i have copied here hoping to arrange them later each in its place according to the subjects of which they may treat but i believe that before i am at the end of this task i shall have to repeat the same things several times for which o reader do not blame me for the subjects are many and memory cannot retain them all and say i will not write this because i wrote it before and if i wished to avoid falling into this fault it would be necessary in every case when i wanted to copy a passage that not to repeat myself i should read over all that had gone before and all the more since the intervals are long between one time of writing and the next footnote in the history of florence in the early part of the xvith century piero di braccio martelli is frequently mentioned as commissario della signoria he was famous for his learning and at his death left four books on mathematics ready for the press comp litta famiglie celebri italiane famiglia martelli di firenze in the official catalogue of mss in the brit mus new series vol i where this passage is printed barto has been wrongly given for braccio addi di marzo the christian era was computed in florence at that time from the incarnation lady day march th hence this should be by our reckoning racolto tratto di molte carte le quali io ho qui copiate we must suppose that leonardo means that he has copied out his own mss and not those of others the first thirteen leaves of the ms in the brit mus are a fair copy of some notes on physics suggestions for the arrangement of mss treating of particular subjects of digging a canal put this in the book of useful inventions and in proving them bring forward the propositions already proved and this is the proper order since if you wished to show the usefulness of any plan you would be obliged again to devise new machines to prove its utility and thus would confuse the order of the forty books and also the order of the diagrams that is to say you would have to mix up practice with theory which would produce a confused and incoherent work i am not to blame for putting forward in the course of my work on science any general rule derived from a previous conclusion the book of the science of mechanics must precede the book of useful inventions have your books on anatomy bound footnote the numerous notes on anatomy written on loose leaves and now in the royal collection at windsor can best be classified in four books corresponding to the different character and size of the paper when leonardo speaks of li tua libri di notomia he probably means the mss which still exist if this hypothesis is correct the present condition of these leaves might seem to prove that he only carried out his purpose with one of the books on anatomy a borrowed book on anatomy is mentioned in f o the order of your book must proceed on this plan first simple beams then those supported from below then suspended in part then wholly suspended then beams as supporting other weights footnote leonardo s notes on mechanics are extraordinarily numerous but for the reasons assigned in my introduction they have not been included in the present work general introductions to the book on painting introduction seeing that i can find no subject specially useful or pleasing since the men who have come before me have taken for their own every useful or necessary theme i must do like one who being poor comes last to the fair and can find no other way of providing himself than by taking all the things already seen by other buyers and not taken but refused by reason of their lesser value i then will load my humble pack with this despised and rejected merchandise the refuse of so many buyers and will go about to distribute it not indeed in great cities but in the poorer towns taking such a price as the wares i offer may be worth footnote it need hardly be pointed out that there is in this proemio a covert irony in the second and third prefaces leonardo characterises his rivals and opponents more closely his protest is directed against neo latinism as professed by most of the humanists of his time its futility is now no longer questioned introduction i know that many will call this useless work footnote questa essere opera inutile by opera we must here understand libro di pittura and particularly the treatise on perspective and they will be those of whom demetrius footnote demetrio with regard to the passage attributed to demetrius dr h m ller str bing writes i know not what to make of it it is certainly not demetrius phalereus that is meant and it can hardly be demetrius poliorcetes who then can it be for the name is a very common one it may be a clerical error for demades and the maxim is quite in the spirit of his writings i have not however been able to find any corresponding passage either in the fragments c muller orat att ii nor in the supplements collected by dietz rhein mus vol p the same passage occurs as a simple memorandum in the ms tr apparently as a note for this proemio thus affording some data as to the time where these introductions were written declared that he took no more account of the wind that came out their mouth in words than of that they expelled from their lower parts men who desire nothing but material riches and are absolutely devoid of that of wisdom which is the food and the only true riches of the mind for so much more worthy as the soul is than the body so much more noble are the possessions of the soul than those of the body and often when i see one of these men take this work in his hand i wonder that he does not put it to his nose like a monkey or ask me if it is something good to eat footnote in the original the proemio d prospettiva cio dell uffitio dell occhio see no stands between this and the preceding one no introduction i am fully concious that not being a literary man certain presumptuous persons will think that they may reasonably blame me alleging that i am not a man of letters foolish folks do they not know that i might retort as marius did to the roman patricians footnote come mario disse ai patriti romani i am unable to find the words here attributed by leonardo to marius either in plutarch s life of marius or in the apophthegmata moralia p nor do they occur in the writings of valerius maximus who frequently mentions marius nor in velleius paterculus ii to dio cassius aulus gellius or macrobius professor e mendelson of dorpat the editor of herodian assures me that no such passage is the found in that author communication from dr muller strubing leonardo evidently meant to allude to some well known incident in roman history and the mention of marius is the result probably of some confusion we may perhaps read for marius menenius agrippa though in that case it is true we must alter patriti to plebei the change is a serious one but it would render the passage perfectly clear by saying that they who deck themselves out in the labours of others will not allow me my own they will say that i having no literary skill cannot properly express that which i desire to treat of footnote le mie cose che d altra parola this can hardly be reconciled with mons ravaisson s estimate of l da vinci s learning leonard de vinci etait un admirateur et un disciple des anciens aussi bien dans l art que dans la science et il tenait a passer pour tel meme aux yeux de la posterite gaz des beaux arts oct but they do not know that my subjects are to be dealt with by experience rather than by words footnote see footnote and experience has been the mistress of those who wrote well and so as mistress i will cite her in all cases though i may not like them be able to quote other authors i shall rely on that which is much greater and more worthy on experience the mistress of their masters they go about puffed up and pompous dressed and decorated with the fruits not of their own labours but of those of others and they will not allow me my own they will scorn me as an inventor but how much more might they who are not inventors but vaunters and declaimers of the works of others be blamed introduction and those men who are inventors and interpreters between nature and man as compared with boasters and declaimers of the works of others must be regarded and not otherwise esteemed than as the object in front of a mirror when compared with its image seen in the mirror for the first is something in itself and the other nothingness folks little indebted to nature since it is only by chance that they wear the human form and without it i might class them with the herds of beasts many will think they may reasonably blame me by alleging that my proofs are opposed to the authority of certain men held in the highest reverence by their inexperienced judgments not considering that my works are the issue of pure and simple experience who is the one true mistress these rules are sufficient to enable you to know the true from the false and this aids men to look only for things that are possible and with due moderation and not to wrap yourself in ignorance a thing which can have no good result so that in despair you would give yourself up to melancholy among all the studies of natural causes and reasons light chiefly delights the beholder and among the great features of mathematics the certainty of its demonstrations is what preeminently tends to elevate the mind of the investigator perspective therefore must be preferred to all the discourses and systems of human learning in this branch of science the beam of light is explained on those methods of demonstration which form the glory not so much of mathematics as of physics and are graced with the flowers of both footnote such of leonardo s notes on optics or on perspective as bear exclusively on mathematics or physics could not be included in the arrangement of the libro di pittura which is here presented to the reader they are however but few but its axioms being laid down at great length i shall abridge them to a conclusive brevity arranging them on the method both of their natural order and of mathematical demonstration sometimes by deduction of the effects from the causes and sometimes arguing the causes from the effects adding also to my own conclusions some which though not included in them may nevertheless be inferred from them thus if the lord who is the light of all things vouchsafe to enlighten me i will treat of light wherefore i will divide the present work into parts footnote in the middle ages for instance by roger bacon by vitellone with whose works leonardo was certainly familiar and by all the writers of the renaissance perspective and optics were not regarded as distinct sciences perspective indeed is in its widest application the science of seeing although to leonardo the two sciences were clearly separate it is not so as to their names thus we find axioms in optics under the heading perspective according to this arrangement of the materials for the theoretical portion of the libro di pittura propositions in perspective and in optics stand side by side or occur alternately although this particular chapter deals only with optics it is not improbable that the words partir la presente opera in parti may refer to the same division into three sections which is spoken of in chapters to the plan of the book on painting on the three branches of perspective there are three branches of perspective the first deals with the reasons of the apparent diminution of objects as they recede from the eye and is known as diminishing perspective the second contains the way in which colours vary as they recede from the eye the third and last is concerned with the explanation of how the objects in a picture ought to be less finished in proportion as they are remote and the names are as follows linear perspective the perspective of colour the perspective of disappearance footnote from the character of the handwriting i infer that this passage was written before the year on painting and perspective the divisions of perspective are as used in drawing of these the first includes the diminution in size of opaque objects the second treats of the diminution and loss of outline in such opaque objects the third of the diminution and loss of colour at long distances footnote the division is here the same as in the previous chapter no and this is worthy of note when we connect it with the fact that a space of about years must have intervened between the writing of the two passages the discourse on painting perspective as bearing on drawing is divided into three principal sections of which the first treats of the diminution in the size of bodies at different distances the second part is that which treats of the diminution in colour in these objects the third deals with the diminished distinctness of the forms and outlines displayed by the objects at various distances on the sections of the book on painting the first thing in painting is that the objects it represents should appear in relief and that the grounds surrounding them at different distances shall appear within the vertical plane of the foreground of the picture by means of the branches of perspective which are the diminution in the distinctness of the forms of the objects the diminution in their magnitude and the diminution in their colour and of these classes of perspective the first results from the structure of the eye while the other two are caused by the atmosphere which intervenes between the eye and the objects seen by it the second essential in painting is appropriate action and a due variety in the figures so that the men may not all look like brothers c footnote this and the two foregoing chapters must have been written in to they undoubtedly indicate the scheme which leonardo wished to carry out in arranging his researches on perspective as applied to painting this is important because it is an evidence against the supposition of h ludwig and others that leonardo had collected his principles of perspective in one book so early as before a book which according to the hypothesis must have been lost at a very early period or destroyed possibly by the french in see h ludwig l da vinci das buch van der malerei vienna iii and the use of the book on painting these rules are of use only in correcting the figures since every man makes some mistakes in his first compositions and he who knows them not cannot amend them but you knowing your errors will correct your works and where you find mistakes amend them and remember never to fall into them again but if you try to apply these rules in composition you will never make an end and will produce confusion in your works these rules will enable you to have a free and sound judgment since good judgment is born of clear understanding and a clear understanding comes of reasons derived from sound rules and sound rules are the issue of sound experience the common mother of all the sciences and arts hence bearing in mind the precepts of my rules you will be able merely by your amended judgment to criticise and recognise every thing that is out of proportion in a work whether in the perspective or in the figures or any thing else necessity of theoretical knowledge of the mistakes made by those who practise without knowledge those who are in love with practice without knowledge are like the sailor who gets into a ship without rudder or compass and who never can be certain whether he is going practice must always be founded on sound theory and to this perspective is the guide and the gateway and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of drawing the painter who draws merely by practice and by eye without any reason is like a mirror which copies every thing placed in front of it without being conscious of their existence the function of the eye introduction to perspective that is of the function of the eye behold here o reader a thing concerning which we cannot trust our forefathers the ancients who tried to define what the soul and life are which are beyond proof whereas those things which can at any time be clearly known and proved by experience remained for many ages unknown or falsely understood the eye whose function we so certainly know by experience has down to my own time been defined by an infinite number of authors as one thing but i find by experience that it is quite another footnote compare the note to no footnote in section we already find it indicated that the study of perspective and of optics is to be based on that of the functions of the eye leonardo also refers to the science of the eye in his astronomical researches for instance in ms f b ordine del provare la terra essere una stella imprima difinisce l occhio c compare also ms e b and f b the principles of astronomical perspective here in the eye forms here colours here the character of every part of the universe are concentrated to a point and that point is so marvellous a thing oh marvellous o stupendous necessity by thy laws thou dost compel every effect to be the direct result of its cause by the shortest path these indeed are miracles in so small a space it can be reproduced and rearranged in its whole expanse describe in your anatomy what proportion there is between the diameters of all the images in the eye and the distance from them of the crystalline lens of the attributes of the eye all concerned in painting painting is concerned with all the attributes of sight which are darkness light solidity and colour form and position distance and propinquity motion and rest this little work of mine will be a tissue of the studies of these attributes reminding the painter of the rules and methods by which he should use his art to imitate all the works of nature which adorn the world on painting variability of the eye st the pupil of the eye contracts in proportion to the increase of light which is reflected in it nd the pupil of the eye expands in proportion to the diminution in the day light or any other light that is reflected in it rd footnote the subject of this third proposition we find fully discussed in ms g a the eye perceives and recognises the objects of its vision with greater intensity in proportion as the pupil is more widely dilated and this can be proved by the case of nocturnal animals such as cats and certain birds as the owl and others in which the pupil varies in a high degree from large to small c when in the dark or in the light th the eye out of doors in an illuminated atmosphere sees darkness behind the windows of houses which nevertheless are light th all colours when placed in the shade appear of an equal degree of darkness among themselves th but all colours when placed in a full light never vary from their true and essential hue of the eye focus of sight if the eye is required to look at an object placed too near to it it cannot judge of it well as happens to a man who tries to see the tip of his nose hence as a general rule nature teaches us that an object can never be seen perfectly unless the space between it and the eye is equal at least to the length of the face differences of perception by one eye and by both eyes of the eye when both eyes direct the pyramid of sight to an object that object becomes clearly seen and comprehended by the eyes objects seen by one and the same eye appear sometimes large and sometimes small the motion of a spectator who sees an object at rest often makes it seem as though the object at rest had acquired the motion of the moving body while the moving person appears to be at rest on painting objects in relief when seen from a short distance with one eye look like a perfect picture if you look with the eye a b at the spot c this point c will appear to be at d f and if you look at it with the eye g h will appear to be at m a picture can never contain in itself both aspects let the object in relief t be seen by both eyes if you will look at the object with the right eye m keeping the left eye n shut the object will appear or fill up the space at a and if you shut the right eye and open the left the object will occupy the space b and if you open both eyes the object will no longer appear at a or b but at e r f why will not a picture seen by both eyes produce the effect of relief as real relief does when seen by both eyes and why should a picture seen with one eye give the same effect of relief as real relief would under the same conditions of light and shade footnote in the sketch m is the left eye and n the right while the text reverses this lettering we must therefore suppose that the face in which the eyes m and n are placed is opposite to the spectator the comparative size of the image depends on the amount of light the eye will hold and retain in itself the image of a luminous body better than that of a shaded object the reason is that the eye is in itself perfectly dark and since two things that are alike cannot be distinguished therefore the night and other dark objects cannot be seen or recognised by the eye light is totally contrary and gives more distinctness and counteracts and differs from the usual darkness of the eye hence it leaves the impression of its image every object we see will appear larger at midnight than at midday and larger in the morning than at midday this happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday than at any other time the pupil which is largest will see objects the largest this is evident when we look at luminous bodies and particularly at those in the sky when the eye comes out of darkness and suddenly looks up at these bodies they at first appear larger and then diminish and if you were to look at those bodies through a small opening you would see them smaller still because a smaller part of the pupil would exercise its function footnote buso in the lomb dialect is the same as buco when the eye coming out of darkness suddenly sees a luminous body it will appear much larger at first sight than after long looking at it the illuminated object will look larger and more brilliant when seen with two eyes than with only one a luminous object will appear smaller in size when the eye sees it through a smaller opening a luminous body of an oval form will appear rounder in proportion as it is farther from the eye why when the eye has just seen the light does the half light look dark to it and in the same way if it turns from the darkness the half light look very bright on painting if the eye when out of doors in the luminous atmosphere sees a place in shadow this will look very much darker than it really is this happens only because the eye when out in the air contracts the pupil in proportion as the atmosphere reflected in it is more luminous and the more the pupil contracts the less luminous do the objects appear that it sees but as soon as the eye enters into a shady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish this occurs because the greater the darkness into which the pupil goes the more its size increases and this increase makes the darkness seem less footnote la luce entrer luce occurs here in the sense of pupil of the eye as in no c a b a i and in many other places on perspective the eye which turns from a white object in the light of the sun and goes into a less fully lighted place will see everything as dark and this happens either because the pupils of the eyes which have rested on this brilliantly lighted white object have contracted so much that given at first a certain extent of surface they will have lost more than of their size and lacking in size they are also deficient in seeing power though you might say to me a little bird then coming down would see comparatively little and from the smallness of his pupils the white might seem black to this i should reply that here we must have regard to the proportion of the mass of that portion of the brain which is given up to the sense of sight and to nothing else or to return this pupil in man dilates and contracts according to the brightness or darkness of surrounding objects and since it takes some time to dilate and contract it cannot see immediately on going out of the light and into the shade nor in the same way out of the shade into the light and this very thing has already deceived me in painting an eye and from that i learnt it experiment showing the dilatation and contraction of the pupil from the motion of the sun and other luminaries in proportion as the sky is darker the stars appear of larger size and if you were to light up the medium these stars would look smaller and this difference arises solely from the pupil which dilates and contracts with the amount of light in the medium which is interposed between the eye and the luminous body let the experiment be made by placing a candle above your head at the same time that you look at a star then gradually lower the candle till it is on a level with the ray that comes from the star to the eye and then you will see the star diminish so much that you will almost lose sight of it footnote no reference is made in the text to the letters on the accompanying diagram the pupil of the eye in the open air changes in size with every degree of motion from the sun and at every degree of its changes one and the same object seen by it will appear of a different size although most frequently the relative scale of surrounding objects does not allow us to detect these variations in any single object we may look at the eye which sees all objects reversed retains the images for some time this conclusion is proved by the results because the eye having gazed at light retains some impression of it after looking at it there remain in the eye images of intense brightness that make any less brilliant spot seem dark until the eye has lost the last trace of the impression of the stronger light ii linear perspective we see clearly from the concluding sentence of section where the author directly addresses the painter that he must certainly have intended to include the elements of mathematics in his book on the art of painting they are therefore here placed at the beginning in section the theory of the pyramid of sight is distinctly and expressly put forward as the fundamental principle of linear perspective and sections to treat of it fully this theory of sight can scarcely be traced to any author of antiquity such passages as occur in euclid for instance may it is true have proved suggestive to the painters of the renaissance but it would be rash to say any thing decisive on this point leon battista alberti treats of the pyramid of sight at some length in his first book of painting but his explanation differs widely from leonardo s in the details leonardo like alberti may have borrowed the broad lines of his theory from some views commonly accepted among painters at the time but he certainly worked out its application in a perfectly original manner the axioms as to the perception of the pyramid of rays are followed by explanations of its origin and proofs of its universal application the author recurs to the subject with endless variations it is evidently of fundamental importance in his artistic theory and practice it is unnecessary to discuss how far this theory has any scientific value at the present day so much as this at any rate seems certain that from the artist s point of view it may still claim to be of immense practical utility according to leonardo on one hand the laws of perspective are an inalienable condition of the existence of objects in space on the other hand by a natural law the eye whatever it sees and wherever it turns is subjected to the perception of the pyramid of rays in the form of a minute target thus it sees objects in perspective independently of the will of the spectator since the eye receives the images by means of the pyramid of rays just as a magnet attracts iron in connection with this we have the function of the eye explained by the camera obscura and this is all the more interesting and important because no writer previous to leonardo had treated of this subject subsequent passages of no less special interest betray his knowledge of refraction and of the inversion of the image in the camera and in the eye from the principle of the transmission of the image to the eye and to the camera obscura he deduces the means of producing an artificial construction of the pyramid of rays or which is the same thing of the image the fundamental axioms as to the angle of sight and the vanishing point are thus presented in a manner which is as complete as it is simple and intelligible leonardo distinguishes between simple and complex perspective the last sections treat of the apparent size of objects at various distances and of the way to estimate it general remarks on perspective on painting perspective is the best guide to the art of painting footnote compare the art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat appear in relief and what is in relief flat the elements of perspective of the point all the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of mathematicians which are the point the line the angle the superficies and the solid the point is unique of its kind and the point has neither height breadth length nor depth whence it is to be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space the line is of three kinds straight curved and sinuous and it has neither breadth height nor depth hence it is indivisible excepting in its length and its ends are two points the angle is the junction of two lines in a point a point is not part of a line of the natural point the smallest natural point is larger than all mathematical points and this is proved because the natural point has continuity and any thing that is continuous is infinitely divisible but the mathematical point is indivisible because it has no size footnote this definition was inserted by leonardo on a ms copy on parchment of the well known trattato d architettura civile e militare c by francesco di giorgio opposite a passage where the author says in prima he da sapere che punto quella parie della quale he nulla linia he luncheza senza pieza c the superficies is a limitation of the body and the limitation of a body is no part of that body and the limitation of one body is that which begins another that which is not part of any body is nothing nothing is that which fills no space if one single point placed in a circle may be the starting point of an infinite number of lines and the termination of an infinite number of lines there must be an infinite number of points separable from this point and these when reunited become one again whence it follows that the part may be equal to the whole the point being indivisible occupies no space that which occupies no space is nothing the limiting surface of one thing is the beginning of another that which is no part of any body is called nothing that which has no limitations has no form the limitations of two conterminous bodies are interchangeably the surface of each all the surfaces of a body are not parts of that body of the line definition of the nature of the line the line has in itself neither matter nor substance and may rather be called an imaginary idea than a real object and this being its nature it occupies no space therefore an infinite number of lines may be conceived of as intersecting each other at a point which has no dimensions and is only of the thickness if thickness it may be called of one single line how we may conclude that a superficies terminates in a point an angular surface is reduced to a point where it terminates in an angle or if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight line then beyond that angle another surface is generated smaller or equal to or larger than the first of drawing outline consider with the greatest care the form of the outlines of every object and the character of their undulations and these undulations must be separately studied as to whether the curves are composed of arched convexities or angular concavities the nature of the outline the boundaries of bodies are the least of all things the proposition is proved to be true because the boundary of a thing is a surface which is not part of the body contained within that surface nor is it part of the air surrounding that body but is the medium interposted between the air and the body as is proved in its place but the lateral boundaries of these bodies is the line forming the boundary of the surface which line is of invisible thickness wherefore o painter do not surround your bodies with lines and above all when representing objects smaller than nature for not only will their external outlines become indistinct but their parts will be invisible from distance definition of perspective drawing is based upon perspective which is nothing else than a thorough knowledge of the function of the eye and this function simply consists in receiving in a pyramid the forms and colours of all the objects placed before it i say in a pyramid because there is no object so small that it will not be larger than the spot where these pyramids are received into the eye therefore if you extend the lines from the edges of each body as they converge you will bring them to a single point and necessarily the said lines must form a pyramid perspective is nothing more than a rational demonstration applied to the consideration of how objects in front of the eye transmit their image to it by means of a pyramid of lines the pyramid is the name i apply to the lines which starting from the surface and edges of each object converge from a distance and meet in a single point perspective is a rational demonstration by which we may practically and clearly understand how objects transmit their own image by lines forming a pyramid centred in the eye perspective is a rational demonstration by which experience confirms that every object sends its image to the eye by a pyramid of lines and bodies of equal size will result in a pyramid of larger or smaller size according to the difference in their distance one from the other by a pyramid of lines i mean those which start from the surface and edges of bodies and converging from a distance meet in a single point a point is said to be that which having no dimensions cannot be divided and this point placed in the eye receives all the points of the cone footnote compare with this the proem no the paragraphs placed in brackets lines and are evidently mere sketches and as such were cancelled by the writer but they serve as a commentary on the final paragraph lines in what way the eye sees objects placed in front of it the perception of the object depends on the direction of the eye supposing that the ball figured above is the ball of the eye and let the small portion of the ball which is cut off by the line s t be the pupil and all the objects mirrored on the centre of the face of the eye by means of the pupil pass on at once and enter the pupil passing through the crystalline humour which does not interfere in the pupil with the things seen by means of the light and the pupil having received the objects by means of the light immediately refers them and transmits them to the intellect by the line a b and you must know that the pupil transmits nothing perfectly to the intellect or common sense excepting when the objects presented to it by means of light reach it by the line a b as for instance by the line b c for although the lines m n and f g may be seen by the pupil they are not perfectly taken in because they do not coincide with the line a b and the proof is this if the eye shown above wants to count the letters placed in front the eye will be obliged to turn from letter to letter because it cannot discern them unless they lie in the line a b as for instance in the line a c all visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a pyramid and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it in the centre of the pupil as figured above footnote in this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and immovable this is plain from line experimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight perspective is a rational demonstration confirmed by experience that all objects transmit their image to the eye by a pyramid of lines by a pyramid of lines i understand those lines which start from the edges of the surface of bodies and converging from a distance meet in a single point and this point in the present instance i will show to be situated in the eye which is the universal judge of all objects by a point i mean that which cannot be divided into parts therefore this point which is situated in the eye being indivisible no body is seen by the eye that is not larger than this point this being the case it is inevitable that the lines which come from the object to the point must form a pyramid and if any man seeks to prove that the sense of sight does not reside in this point but rather in the black spot which is visible in the middle of the pupil i might reply to him that a small object could never diminish at any distance as it might be a grain of millet or of oats or of some similar thing and that object if it were larger than the said black spot would never be seen as a whole as may be seen in the diagram below let a be the seat of sight b e the lines which reach the eye let e d be the grains of millet within these lines you plainly see that these will never diminish by distance and that the body m n could not be entirely covered by it therefore you must confess that the eye contains within itself one single indivisible point a to which all the points converge of the pyramid of lines starting from an object as is shown below let a b be the eye in the centre of it is the point above mentioned if the line e f is to enter as an image into so small an opening in the eye you must confess that the smaller object cannot enter into what is smaller than itself unless it is diminished and by diminishing it must take the form of a pyramid perspective perspective comes in where judgment fails as to the distance in objects which diminish the eye can never be a true judge for determining with exactitude how near one object is to another which is equal to it in size if the top of that other is on the level of the eye which sees them on that side excepting by means of the vertical plane which is the standard and guide of perspective let n be the eye e f the vertical plane above mentioned let a b c d be the three divisions one below the other if the lines a n and c n are of a given length and the eye n is in the centre then a b will look as large as b c c d is lower and farther off from n therefore it will look smaller and the same effect will appear in the three divisions of a face when the eye of the painter who is drawing it is on a level with the eye of the person he is painting to prove how objects reach the eye if you look at the sun or some other luminous body and then shut your eyes you will see it again inside your eye for a long time this is evidence that images enter into the eye the relations of the distance points to the vanishing point elements of perspective all objects transmit their image to the eye in pyramids and the nearer to the eye these pyramids are intersected the smaller will the image appear of the objects which cause them therefore you may intersect the pyramid with a vertical plane footnote pariete compare the definitions in these lines refer exclusively to the third diagram for the better understanding of this it should be observed that c s must be regarded as representing the section or profile of a square plane placed horizontally comp lines for which the word pianura is subsequently employed lines contain certain preliminary observations to guide the reader in understanding the diagram the last three seem to have been added as a supplement leonardo s mistake in writing t denota line for f denota has been rectified which reaches the base of the pyramid as is shown in the plane a n the eye f and the eye t are one and the same thing but the eye f marks the distance that is to say how far you are standing from the object and the eye t shows you the direction of it that is whether you are opposite or on one side or at an angle to the object you are looking at and remember that the eye f and the eye t must always be kept on the same level for example if you raise or lower the eye from the distance point f you must do the same with the direction point t and if the point f shows how far the eye is distant from the square plane but does not show on which side it is placed and if in the same way the point t show s the direction and not the distance in order to ascertain both you must use both points and they will be one and the same thing if the eye f could see a perfect square of which all the sides were equal to the distance between s and c and if at the nearest end of the side towards the eye a pole were placed or some other straight object set up by a perpendicular line as shown at r s then i say that if you were to look at the side of the square that is nearest to you it will appear at the bottom of the vertical plane r s and then look at the farther side and it would appear to you at the height of the point n on the vertical plane thus by this example you can understand that if the eye is above a number of objects all placed on the same level one beyond another the more remote they are the higher they will seem up to the level of the eye but no higher because objects placed upon the level on which your feet stand so long as it is flat even if it be extended into infinity would never be seen above the eye since the eye has in itself the point towards which all the cones tend and converge which convey the images of the objects to the eye and this point always coincides with the point of diminution which is the extreme of all we can see and from the base line of the first pyramid as far as the diminishing point footnote the two diagrams above the chapter are explained by the first five lines they have however more letters than are referred to in the text a circumstance we frequently find occasion to remark there are only bases without pyramids which constantly diminish up to this point and from the first base where the vertical plane is placed towards the point in the eye there will be only pyramids without bases as shown in the example given above now let a b be the said vertical plane and r the point of the pyramid terminating in the eye and n the point of diminution which is always in a straight line opposite the eye and always moves as the eye moves just as when a rod is moved its shadow moves and moves with it precisely as the shadow moves with a body and each point is the apex of a pyramid all having a common base with the intervening vertical plane but although their bases are equal their angles are not equal because the diminishing point is the termination of a smaller angle than that of the eye if you ask me by what practical experience can you show me these points i reply so far as concerns the diminishing point which moves with you when you walk by a ploughed field look at the straight furrows which come down with their ends to the path where you are walking and you will see that each pair of furrows will look as though they tried to get nearer and meet at the farther end footnote for the easier understanding of the diagram and of its connection with the preceding i may here remark that the square plane shown above in profile by the line c s is here indicated by e d o p according to lines a b must be imagined as a plane of glass placed perpendicularly at o p how to measure the pyramid of vision as regards the point in the eye it is made more intelligible by this if you look into the eye of another person you will see your own image now imagine lines starting from your ears and going to the ears of that image which you see in the other man s eye you will understand that these lines converge in such a way that they would meet in a point a little way beyond your own image mirrored in the eye and if you want to measure the diminution of the pyramid in the air which occupies the space between the object seen and the eye you must do it according to the diagram figured below let m n be a tower and e f a rod which you must move backwards and forwards till its ends correspond with those of the tower footnote i sua stremi della storre its ends of the tower this is the case at e f then bring it nearer to the eye at c d and you will see that the image of the tower seems smaller as at r o then again bring it closer to the eye and you will see the rod project far beyond the image of the tower from a to b and from t to b and so you will discern that a little farther within the lines must converge in a point the production of pyramid of vision perspective the instant the atmosphere is illuminated it will be filled with an infinite number of images which are produced by the various bodies and colours assembled in it and the eye is the target a loadstone of these images the whole surface of opaque bodies displays its whole image in all the illuminated atmosphere which surrounds them on all sides that the atmosphere attracts to itself like a loadstone all the images of the objects that exist in it and not their forms merely but their nature may be clearly seen by the sun which is a hot and luminous body all the atmosphere which is the all pervading matter absorbs light and heat and reflects in itself the image of the source of that heat and splendour and in each minutest portion does the same the northpole does the same as the loadstone shows and the moon and the other planets without suffering any diminution do the same among terrestrial things musk does the same and other perfumes all bodies together and each by itself give off to the surrounding air an infinite number of images which are all pervading and each complete each conveying the nature colour and form of the body which produces it it can clearly be shown that all bodies are by their images all pervading in the surrounding atmosphere and each complete in itself as to substance form and colour this is seen by the images of the various bodies which are reproduced in one single perforation through which they transmit the objects by lines which intersect and cause reversed pyramids from the objects so that they are upside down on the dark plane where they are first reflected the reason of this is footnote the diagram intended to illustrate the statement pl ii no i occurs in the original between lines and the three circles must be understood to represent three luminous bodies which transmit their images through perforations in a wall into a dark chamber according to a law which is more fully explained in so far as concerns the present passage the diagram is only intended to explain that the images of the three bodies may be made to coalesce at any given spot in the circles are written giallo yellow bi cho white rosso red the text breaks off at line the paragraph no follows here in the original ms every point is the termination of an infinite number of lines which diverge to form a base and immediately from the base the same lines converge to a pyramid imaging both the colour and form no sooner is a form created or compounded than suddenly infinite lines and angles are produced from it and these lines distributing themselves and intersecting each other in the air give rise to an infinite number of angles opposite to each other given a base each opposite angle will form a triangle having a form and proportion equal to the larger angle and if the base goes twice into each of the lines of the pyramid the smaller triangle will do the same every body in light and shade fills the surrounding air with infinite images of itself and these by infinite pyramids diffused in the air represent this body throughout space and on every side each pyramid that is composed of a long assemblage of rays includes within itself an infinite number of pyramids and each has the same power as all and all as each a circle of equidistant pyramids of vision will give to their object angles of equal size and an eye at each point will see the object of the same size the body of the atmosphere is full of infinite pyramids composed of radiating straight lines which are produced from the surface of the bodies in light and shade existing in the air and the farther they are from the object which produces them the more acute they become and although in their distribution they intersect and cross they never mingle together but pass through all the surrounding air independently converging spreading and diffused and they are all of equal power and value all equal to each and each equal to all by these the images of objects are transmitted through all space and in every direction and each pyramid in itself includes in each minutest part the whole form of the body causing it the body of the atmosphere is full of infinite radiating pyramids produced by the objects existing in it these intersect and cross each other with independent convergence without interfering with each other and pass through all the surrounding atmosphere and are of equal force and value all being equal to each each to all and by means of these images of the body are transmitted everywhere and on all sides and each receives in itself every minutest portion of the object that produces it proof by experiment perspective the air is filled with endless images of the objects distributed in it and all are represented in all and all in one and all in each whence it happens that if two mirrors are placed in such a manner as to face each other exactly the first will be reflected in the second and the second in the first the first being reflected in the second takes to it the image of itself with all the images represented in it among which is the image of the second mirror and so image within image they go on to infinity in such a manner as that each mirror has within it a mirror each smaller than the last and one inside the other thus by this example it is clearly proved that every object sends its image to every spot whence the object itself can be seen and the converse that the same object may receive in itself all the images of the objects that are in front of it hence the eye transmits through the atmosphere its own image to all the objects that are in front of it and receives them into itself that is to say on its surface whence they are taken in by the common sense which considers them and if they are pleasing commits them to the memory whence i am of opinion that the invisible images in the eyes are produced towards the object as the image of the object to the eye that the images of the objects must be disseminated through the air an instance may be seen in several mirrors placed in a circle which will reflect each other endlessly when one has reached the other it is returned to the object that produced it and thence being diminished it is returned again to the object and then comes back once more and this happens endlessly if you put a light between two flat mirrors with a distance of braccio between them you will see in each of them an infinite number of lights one smaller than another to the last if at night you put a light between the walls of a room all the parts of that wall will be tinted with the image of that light and they will receive the light and the light will fall on them mutually that is to say when there is no obstacle to interrupt the transmission of the images this same example is seen in a greater degree in the distribution of the solar rays which all together and each by itself convey to the object the image of the body which causes it that each body by itself alone fills with its images the atmosphere around it and that the same air is able at the same time to receive the images of the endless other objects which are in it this is clearly proved by these examples and every object is everywhere visible in the whole of the atmosphere and the whole in every smallest part of it and all the objects in the whole and all in each smallest part each in all and all in every part the images of objects are all diffused through the atmosphere which receives them and all on every side in it to prove this let a c e be objects of which the images are admitted to a dark chamber by the small holes n p and thrown upon the plane f i opposite to these holes as many images will be produced in the chamber on the plane as the number of the said holes general conclusions all objects project their whole image and likeness diffused and mingled in the whole of the atmosphere opposite to themselves the image of every point of the bodily surface exists in every part of the atmosphere all the images of the objects are in every part of the atmosphere the whole and each part of the image of the atmosphere is reflected in each point of the surface of the bodies presented to it therefore both the part and the whole of the images of the objects exist both in the whole and in the parts of the surface of these visible bodies whence we may evidently say that the image of each object exists as a whole and in every part in each part and in the whole interchangeably in every existing body as is seen in two mirrors placed opposite to each other that the contrary is impossible it is impossible that the eye should project from itself by visual rays the visual virtue since as soon as it opens that front portion of the eye which would give rise to this emanation would have to go forth to the object and this it could not do without time and this being so it could not travel so high as the sun in a month s time when the eye wanted to see it and if it could reach the sun it would necessarily follow that it should perpetually remain in a continuous line from the eye to the sun and should always diverge in such a way as to form between the sun and the eye the base and the apex of a pyramid this being the case if the eye consisted of a million worlds it would not prevent its being consumed in the projection of its virtue and if this virtue would have to travel through the air as perfumes do the winds would bent it and carry it into another place but we do in fact see the mass of the sun with the same rapidity as an object at the distance of a braccio and the power of sight is not disturbed by the blowing of the winds nor by any other accident footnote the view here refuted by leonardo was maintained among others by bramantino leonardo s milanese contemporary lomazzo writes as follows in his trattato dell arte della pittura c milano libr v cp xxi sovviemmi di aver gi letto

that leonardo had made his memorandum refuting this view at milan in a parallel case just as a stone flung into the water becomes the centre and cause of many circles and as sound diffuses itself in circles in the air so any object placed in the luminous atmosphere diffuses itself in circles and fills the surrounding air with infinite images of itself and is repeated the whole every where and the whole in every smallest part this can be proved by experiment since if you shut a window that faces west and make a hole footnote here the text breaks off footnote compare libri histoire des sciences math matiques en italie tome iii p the function of the eye as explained by the camera obscura if the object in front of the eye sends its image to the eye the eye on the other hand sends its image to the object and no portion whatever of the object is lost in the images it throws off for any reason either in the eye or the object therefore we may rather believe it to be the nature and potency of our luminous atmosphere which absorbs the images of the objects existing in it than the nature of the objects to send their images through the air if the object opposite to the eye were to send its image to the eye the eye would have to do the same to the object whence it might seem that these images were an emanation but if so it would be necessary to admit that every object became rapidly smaller because each object appears by its images in the surrounding atmosphere that is the whole object in the whole atmosphere and in each part and all the objects in the whole atmosphere and all of them in each part speaking of that atmosphere which is able to contain in itself the straight and radiating lines of the images projected by the objects from this it seems necessary to admit that it is in the nature of the atmosphere which subsists between the objects and which attracts the images of things to itself like a loadstone being placed between them prove how all objects placed in one position are all everywhere and all in each part i say that if the front of a building or any open piazza or field which is illuminated by the sun has a dwelling opposite to it and if in the front which does not face the sun you make a small round hole all the illuminated objects will project their images through that hole and be visible inside the dwelling on the opposite wall which may be made white and there in fact they will be upside down and if you make similar openings in several places in the same wall you will have the same result from each hence the images of the illuminated objects are all everywhere on this wall and all in each minutest part of it the reason as we clearly know is that this hole must admit some light to the said dwelling and the light admitted by it is derived from one or many luminous bodies if these bodies are of various colours and shapes the rays forming the images are of various colours and shapes and so will the representations be on the wall footnote this section has already been published in the saggio delle opere di leonardo da vinci milan pp g govi observes upon it that leonardo is not to be regarded as the inventor of the camera obscura but that he was the first to explain by it the structure of the eye an account of the camera obscura first occurs in cesare cesarini s italian version of vitruvius pub four years after leonardo s death cesarini expressly names benedettino don papnutio as the inventor of the camera obscura in his explanation of the function of the eye by a comparison with the camera obscura leonardo was the precursor of g cardano professor of medicine at bologna died and it appears highly probable that this is in fact the very discovery which leonardo ascribes to himself in section without giving any further details how the images of objects received by the eye intersect within the crystalline humour of the eye an experiment showing how objects transmit their images or pictures intersecting within the eye in the crystalline humour is seen when by some small round hole penetrate the images of illuminated objects into a very dark chamber then receive these images on a white paper placed within this dark room and rather near to the hole and you will see all the objects on the paper in their proper forms and colours but much smaller and they will be upside down by reason of that very intersection these images being transmitted from a place illuminated by the sun will seem actually painted on this paper which must be extremely thin and looked at from behind and let the little perforation be made in a very thin plate of iron let a b e d e be the object illuminated by the sun and o r the front of the dark chamber in which is the said hole at n m let s t be the sheet of paper intercepting the rays of the images of these objects upside down because the rays being straight a on the right hand becomes k on the left and e on the left becomes f on the right and the same takes place inside the pupil footnote this chapter is already known through a translation into french by venturi compare his essai sur les ouvrages physico math matiques de l da vinci avec des fragments tir s de ses manuscrits apport s de l italie lu a la premiere classe de l institut national des sciences et arts paris an v the practice of perspective in the practice of perspective the same rules apply to light and to the eye the object which is opposite to the pupil of the eye is seen by that pupil and that which is opposite to the eye is seen by the pupil refraction of the rays falling upon the eye the lines sent forth by the image of an object to the eye do not reach the point within the eye in straight lines if the judgment of the eye is situated within it the straight lines of the images are refracted on its surface because they pass through the rarer to the denser medium if when you are under water you look at objects in the air you will see them out of their true place and the same with objects under water seen from the air the intersection of the rays the inversion of the images all the images of objects which pass through a window glass pane from the free outer air to the air confined within walls are seen on the opposite side and an object which moves in the outer air from east to west will seem in its shadow on the wall which is lighted by this confined air to have an opposite motion the principle on which the images of bodies pass in between the margins of the openings by which they enter what difference is there in the way in which images pass through narrow openings and through large openings or in those which pass by the sides of shaded bodies by moving the edges of the opening through which the images are admitted the images of immovable objects are made to move and this happens as is shown in the th which demonstrates footnote per la a che dicie when leonardo refers thus to a number it serves to indicate marginal diagrams this can in some instances be distinctly proved the ninth sketch on the page w l b corresponds to the middle sketch of the three reproduced the images of any object are all everywhere and all in each part of the surrounding air it follows that if one of the edges of the hole by which the images are admitted to a dark chamber is moved it cuts off those rays of the image that were in contact with it and gets nearer to other rays which previously were remote from it c of the movement of the edge at the right or left or the upper or lower edge if you move the right side of the opening the image on the left will move being that of the object which entered on the right side of the opening and the same result will happen with all the other sides of the opening this can be proved by the nd of this which shows all the rays which convey the images of objects through the air are straight lines hence if the images of very large bodies have to pass through very small holes and beyond these holes recover their large size the lines must necessarily intersect footnote in the first of the three diagrams leonardo had drawn only one of the two margins et m necessity has provided that all the images of objects in front of the eye shall intersect in two places one of these intersections is in the pupil the other in the crystalline lens and if this were not the case the eye could not see so great a number of objects as it does this can be proved since all the lines which intersect do so in a point because nothing is seen of objects excepting their surface and their edges are lines in contradistinction to the definition of a surface and each minute part of a line is equal to a point for smallest is said of that than which nothing can be smaller and this definition is equivalent to the definition of the point hence it is possible for the whole circumference of a circle to transmit its image to the point of intersection as is shown in the th of this which shows all the smallest parts of the images cross each other without interfering with each other these demonstrations are to illustrate the eye no image even of the smallest object enters the eye without being turned upside down but as it penetrates into the crystalline lens it is once more reversed and thus the image is restored to the same position within the eye as that of the object outside the eye of the central line of the eye only one line of the image of all those that reach the visual virtue has no intersection and this has no sensible dimensions because it is a mathematical line which originates from a mathematical point which has no dimensions according to my adversary necessity requires that the central line of every image that enters by small and narrow openings into a dark chamber shall be turned upside down together with the images of the bodies that surround it as to whether the central line of the image can be intersected or not within the opening it is impossible that the line should intersect itself that is that its right should cross over to its left side and so its left side become its right side because such an intersection demands two lines one from each side for there can be no motion from right to left or from left to right in itself without such extension and thickness as admit of such motion and if there is extension it is no longer a line but a surface and we are investigating the properties of a line and not of a surface and as the line having no centre of thickness cannot be divided we must conclude that the line can have no sides to intersect each other this is proved by the movement of the line a f to a b and of the line e b to e f which are the sides of the surface a f e b but if you move the line a b and the line e f with the frontends a e to the spot c you will have moved the opposite ends f b towards each other at the point d and from the two lines you will have drawn the straight line c d which cuts the middle of the intersection of these two lines at the point n without any intersection for you imagine these two lines as having breadth it is evident that by this motion the first will entirely cover the other being equal with it without any intersection in the position c d and this is sufficient to prove our proposition how the innumerable rays from innumerable images can converge to a point just as all lines can meet at a point without interfering with each other being without breadth or thickness in the same way all the images of surfaces can meet there and as each given point faces the object opposite to it and each object faces an opposite point the converging rays of the image can pass through the point and diverge again beyond it to reproduce and re magnify the real size of that image but their impressions will appear reversed as is shown in the first above where it is said that every image intersects as it enters the narrow openings made in a very thin substance read the marginal text on the other side in proportion as the opening is smaller than the shaded body so much less will the images transmitted through this opening intersect each other the sides of images which pass through openings into a dark room intersect at a point which is nearer to the opening in proportion as the opening is narrower to prove this let a b be an object in light and shade which sends not its shadow but the image of its darkened form through the opening d e which is as wide as this shaded body and its sides a b being straight lines as has been proved must intersect between the shaded object and the opening but nearer to the opening in proportion as it is smaller than the object in shade as is shown on your right hand and your left hand in the two diagrams a b c n m o where the right opening d e being equal in width to the shaded object a b the intersection of the sides of the said shaded object occurs half way between the opening and the shaded object at the point c but this cannot happen in the left hand figure the opening o being much smaller than the shaded object n m it is impossible that the images of objects should be seen between the objects and the openings through which the images of these bodies are admitted and this is plain because where the atmosphere is illuminated these images are not formed visibly when the images are made double by mutually crossing each other they are invariably doubly as dark in tone to prove this let d e h be such a doubling which although it is only seen within the space between the bodies in b and i this will not hinder its being seen from f g or from f m being composed of the images a b i k which run together in d e h footnote on the original diagram at the beginning of this chapter leonardo has written azurro blue where in the facsimile i have marked a and giallo yellow where b stands footnote these lines stand between the diagrams i and iii footnote these lines stand between the diagrams i and ii footnote are written along the left side of diagram i an experiment showing that though the pupil may not be moved from its position the objects seen by it may appear to move from their places if you look at an object at some distance from you and which is below the eye and fix both your eyes upon it and with one hand firmly hold the upper lid open while with the other you push up the under lid still keeping your eyes fixed on the object gazed at you will see that object double one image remaining steady and the other moving in a contrary direction to the pressure of your finger on the lower eyelid how false the opinion is of those who say that this happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its position how the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down in seeing footnote the subject indicated by these two headings is fully discussed in the two chapters that follow them in the original but it did not seem to me appropriate to include them here demostration of perspective by means of a vertical glass plane of the plane of glass perspective is nothing else than seeing place or objects behind a plane of glass quite transparent on the surface of which the objects behind that glass are to be drawn these can be traced in pyramids to the point in the eye and these pyramids are intersected on the glass plane pictorial perspective can never make an object at the same distance look of the same size as it appears to the eye you see that the apex of the pyramid f c d is as far from the object c d as the same point f is from the object a b and yet c d which is the base made by the painter s point is smaller than a b which is the base of the lines from the objects converging in the eye and refracted at s t the surface of the eye this may be proved by experiment by the lines of vision and then by the lines of the painter s plumbline by cutting the real lines of vision on one and the same plane and measuring on it one and the same object perspective the vertical plane is a perpendicular line imagined as in front of the central point where the apex of the pyramids converge and this plane bears the same relation to this point as a plane of glass would through which you might see the various objects and draw them on it and the objects thus drawn would be smaller than the originals in proportion as the distance between the glass and the eye was smaller than that between the glass and the objects perspective the different converging pyramids produced by the objects will show on the plane the various sizes and remoteness of the objects causing them perspective all those horizontal planes of which the extremes are met by perpendicular lines forming right angles if they are of equal width the more they rise to the level of eye the less this is seen and the more the eye is above them the more will their real width be seen perspective the farther a spherical body is from the eye the more you will see of it the angle of sight varies with the distance a simple and natural method showing how objects appear to the eye without any other medium the object that is nearest to the eye always seems larger than another of the same size at greater distance the eye m seeing the spaces o v x hardly detects the difference between them and the reason of this is that it is close to them footnote it is quite inconceivable to me why m ravaisson in a note to his french translation of this simple passage should have remarked il est clair que c est par erreur que leonard a crit per esser visino au lieu de per non esser visino see his printed ed of ms a p but if these spaces are marked on the vertical plane n o the space o v will be seen at o r and in the same way the space v x will appear at r q and if you carry this out in any place where you can walk round it will look out of proportion by reason of the great difference in the spaces o r and r q and this proceeds from the eye being so much below near the plane that the plane is foreshortened hence if you wanted to carry it out you would have to arrange to see the perspective through a single hole which must be at the point m or else you must go to a distance of at least times the height of the object you see the plane o p being always equally remote from the eye will reproduce the objects in a satisfactory way so that they may be seen from place to place how every large mass sends forth its images which may diminish through infinity the images of any large mass being infinitely divisible may be infinitely diminished objects of equal size situated in various places will be seen by different pyramids which will each be smaller in proportion as the object is farther off perspective in dealing with distances makes use of two opposite pyramids one of which has its apex in the eye and the base as distant as the horizon the other has the base towards the eye and the apex on the horizon now the first includes the visible universe embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of the eye as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small opening for the more remote the objects are from the eye the greater number can be seen through the opening and thus the pyramid is constructed with the base on the horizon and the apex in the eye as has been said the second pyramid is extended to a spot which is smaller in proportion as it is farther from the eye and this second perspective pyramid results from the first simple perspective simple perspective is that which is constructed by art on a vertical plane which is equally distant from the eye in every part complex perspective is that which is constructed on a ground plan in which none of the parts are equally distant from the eye perspective no surface can be seen exactly as it is if the eye that sees it is not equally remote from all its edges why when an object is placed close to the eye its edges are indistinct when an object opposite the eye is brought too close to it its edges must become too confused to be distinguished as it happens with objects close to a light which cast a large and indistinct shadow so is it with an eye which estimates objects opposite to it in all cases of linear perspective the eye acts in the same way as the light and the reason is that the eye has one leading line of vision which dilates with distance and embraces with true discernment large objects at a distance as well as small ones that are close but since the eye sends out a multitude of lines which surround this chief central one and since these which are farthest from the centre in this cone of lines are less able to discern with accuracy it follows that an object brought close to the eye is not at a due distance but is too near for the central line to be able to discern the outlines of the object so the edges fall within the lines of weaker discerning power and these are to the function of the eye like dogs in the chase which can put up the game but cannot take it thus these cannot take in the objects but induce the central line of sight to turn upon them when they have put them up hence the objects which are seen with these lines of sight have confused outlines the relative size of objects with regard to their distance from the eye perspective small objects close at hand and large ones at a distance being seen within equal angles will appear of the same size perspective there is no object so large but that at a great distance from the eye it does not appear smaller than a smaller object near among objects of equal size that which is most remote from the eye will look the smallest footnote this axiom sufficiently clear in itself is in the original illustrated by a very large diagram constructed like that here reproduced under no the same idea is repeated in c a i a i a stated as follows infra le cose d equal grandeza quella si dimostra di minor figura che sara pi distante dall ochio why an object is less distinct when brought near to the eye and why with spectacles or without the naked eye sees badly either close or far off as the case may be perspective among objects of equal size that which is most remote from the eye will look the smallest perspective no second object can be so much lower than the first as that the eye will not see it higher than the first if the eye is above the second perspective and this second object will never be so much higher than the first as that the eye being below them will not see the second as lower than the first perspective if the eye sees a second square through the centre of a smaller one that is nearer the second larger square will appear to be surrounded by the smaller one perspective proposition objects that are farther off can never be so large but that those in front though smaller will conceal or surround them definition this proposition can be proved by experiment for if you look through a small hole there is nothing so large that it cannot be seen through it and the object so seen appears surrounded and enclosed by the outline of the sides of the hole and if you stop it up this small stopping will conceal the view of the largest object the apparent size of objects defined by calculation of linear perspective linear perspective deals with the action of the lines of sight in proving by measurement how much smaller is a second object than the first and how much the third is smaller than the second and so on by degrees to the end of things visible i find by experience that if a second object is as far beyond the first as the first is from the eye although they are of the same size the second will seem half the size of the first and if the third object is of the same size as the nd and the rd is as far beyond the second as the nd from the first it will appear of half the size of the second and so on by degrees at equal distances the next farthest will be half the size of the former object so long as the space does not exceed the length of braccia but beyond braccia figures of equal size will lose and at braccia they will lose and at braccia and so on diminishing by degrees this is if the picture plane is distant from you twice your own height if it is only as far off as your own height there will be a great difference between the first braccia and the second footnote this chapter is included in dufresne s and manzi s editions of the treatise on painting h ludwig in his commentary calls this chapter eines der wichtigsten im ganzen tractat but at the same time he asserts that its substance has been so completely disfigured in the best ms copies that we ought not to regard leonardo as responsible for it however in the case of this chapter the old ms copies agree with the original as it is reproduced above from the chapters given later in this edition which were written at a subsequent date it would appear that leonardo corrected himself on these points of the diminution of objects at various distances a second object as far distant from the first as the first is from the eye will appear half the size of the first though they be of the same size really of the degrees of diminution if you place the vertical plane at one braccio from the eye the first object being at a distance of braccia from your eye will diminish to of its height at that plane and if it is braccia from the eye to and if it is braccia off it will diminish to of its height and so on by degrees as the space doubles the diminution will double begin from the line m f with the eye below then go up and do the same with the line n f then with the eye above and close to the gauges on the ground look at m n then as c m is to m n so will n m be to n s if a n goes times into f b m p will do the same into p g then go backwards so far as that c d goes twice into a n and p g will be equal to g h and m p will go into h p as often as d c into o p footnote the first three lines are unfortunately very obscure i give the degrees of the objects seen by the eye as the musician does the notes heard by the ear although the objects seen by the eye do in fact touch each other as they recede i will nevertheless found my rule on spaces of braccia each as a musician does with notes which though they can be carried on one into the next he divides into degrees from note to note calling them st nd rd th th and has affixed a name to each degree in raising or lowering the voice perspective let f be the level and distance of the eye and a the vertical plane as high as a man let e be a man then i say that on the plane this will be the distance from the plane to the nd man the differences in the diminution of objects of equal size in consequence of their various remoteness from the eye will bear among themselves the same proportions as those of the spaces between the eye and the different objects find out how much a man diminishes at a certain distance and what its length is and then at twice that distance and at times and so make your general rule the eye cannot judge where an object high up ought to descend perspective if two similar and equal objects are placed one beyond the other at a given distance the difference in their size will appear greater in proportion as they are nearer to the eye that sees them and conversely there will seem to be less difference in their size in proportion as they are remote from the eve this is proved by the proportions of their distances among themselves for if the first of these two objects were as far from the eye as the nd from the first this would be called the second proportion since if the first is at braccia from the eye and the nd at two braccia two being twice as much as one the first object will look twice as large as the second but if you place the first at a hundred braccia from you and the second at a hundred and one you will find that the first is only so much larger than the second as is less than and the converse is equally true and again the same thing is proved by the th of this book which shows that among objects that are equal there is the same proportion in the diminution of the size as in the increase in the distance from the eye of the spectator on natural perspective of equal objects the most remote look the smallest the practice of perspective may be divided into parts footnote in parte the space for the number is left blank in the original of which the first treats of objects seen by the eye at any distance and it shows all these objects just as the eye sees them diminished without obliging a man to stand in one place rather than another so long as the plane does not produce a second foreshortening but the second practice is a combination of perspective derived partly from art and partly from nature and the work done by its rules is in every portion of it influenced by natural perspective and artificial perspective by natural perspective i mean that the plane on which this perspective is represented is a flat surface and this plane although it is parallel both in length and height is forced to diminish in its remoter parts more than in its nearer ones and this is proved by the first of what has been said above and its diminution is natural but artificial perspective that is that which is devised by art does the contrary for objects equal in size increase on the plane where it is foreshortened in proportion as the eye is more natural and nearer to the plane and as the part of the plane on which it is figured is farther from the eye and let this plane be d e on which are seen equal circles which are beyond this plane d e that is the circles a b c now you see that the eye h sees on the vertical plane the sections of the images largest of those that are farthest and smallest of the nearest here follows what is wanting in the margin at the foot on the other side of this page natural perspective acts in a contrary way for at greater distances the object seen appears smaller and at a smaller distance the object appears larger but this said invention requires the spectator to stand with his eye at a small hole and then at that small hole it will be very plain but since many men s eyes endeavour at the same time to see one and the same picture produced by this artifice only one can see clearly the effect of this perspective and all the others will see confusion it is well therefore to avoid such complex perspective and hold to simple perspective which does not regard planes as foreshortened but as much as possible in their proper form this simple perspective in which the plane intersects the pyramids by which the images are conveyed to the eye at an equal distance from the eye is our constant experience from the curved form of the pupil of the eye on which the pyramids are intersected at an equal distance from the visual virtue footnote la prima di sopra i e the first of the three diagrams which in the original ms are placed in the margin at the beginning of this chapter of a mixture of natural and artificial perspective this diagram distinguishes natural from artificial perspective but before proceeding any farther i will define what is natural and what is artificial perspective natural perspective says that the more remote of a series of objects of equal size will look the smaller and conversely the nearer will look the larger and the apparent size will diminish in proportion to the distance but in artificial perspective when objects of unequal size are placed at various distances the smallest is nearer to the eye than the largest and the greatest distance looks as though it were the least of all and the cause of this is the plane on which the objects are represented and which is at unequal distances from the eye throughout its length and this diminution of the plane is natural but the perspective shown upon it is artificial since it nowhere agrees with the true diminution of the said plane whence it follows that when the eye is somewhat removed from the station point of the perspective that it has been gazing at all the objects represented look monstrous and this does not occur in natural perspective which has been defined above let us say then that the square a b c d figured above is foreshortened being seen by the eye situated in the centre of the side which is in front but a mixture of artificial and natural perspective will be seen in this tetragon called el main footnote el main is quite legibly written in the original the meaning and derivation of the word are equally doubtful that is to say e f g h which must appear to the eye of the spectator to be equal to a b c d so long as the eye remains in its first position between c and d and this will be seen to have a good effect because the natural perspective of the plane will conceal the defects which would otherwise seem monstrous iii six books on light and shade linear perspective cannot be immediately followed by either the prospettiva de perdimenti or the prospettiva de colori or the aerial perspective since these branches of the subject presuppose a knowledge of the principles of light and shade no apology therefore is here needed for placing these immediately after linear perspective we have various plans suggested by leonardo for the arrangement of the mass of materials treating of this subject among these i have given the preference to a scheme propounded in no iii because in all probability we have here a final and definite purpose expressed several authors have expressed it as their opinion that the paris manuscript c is a complete and finished treatise on light and shade certainly the principles of light and shade form by far the larger portion of this ms which consists of two separate parts still the materials are far from being finally arranged it is also evident that he here investigates the subject from the point of view of the physicist rather than from that of the painter the plan of a scheme of arrangement suggested in no iii and adopted by me has been strictly adhered to for the first four books for the three last however few materials have come down to us and it must be admitted that these three books would find a far more appropriate place in a work on physics than in a treatise on painting for this reason i have collected in book v all the chapters on reflections and in book vi i have put together and arranged all the sections of ms c that belong to the book on painting so far as they relate to light and shade while the sections of the same ms which treat of the prospettiva de perdimenti have of course been excluded from the series on light and shade footnote iii this text has already been published with some slight variations in dozio s pamphlet degli scritti e disegni di leonardo da vinci milan pp dozio did not transcribe it from the original ms which seems to have remained unknown to him but from an old copy ms h in the ambrosian library general introduction prolegomena you must first explain the theory and then the practice first you must describe the shadows and lights on opaque objects and then on transparent bodies scheme of the books on light and shade introduction having already treated of the nature of shadows and the way in which they are cast footnote avendo io tractato we may suppose that he here refers to some particular ms possibly paris c i will now consider the places on which they fall and their curvature obliquity flatness or in short any character i may be able to detect in them shadow is the obstruction of light shadows appear to me to be of supreme importance in perspective because without them opaque and solid bodies will be ill defined that which is contained within their outlines and their boundaries themselves will be ill understood unless they are shown against a background of a different tone from themselves and therefore in my first proposition concerning shadow i state that every opaque body is surrounded and its whole surface enveloped in shadow and light and on this proposition i build up the first book besides this shadows have in themselves various degrees of darkness because they are caused by the absence of a variable amount of the luminous rays and these i call primary shadows because they are the first and inseparable from the object to which they belong and on this i will found my second book from these primary shadows there result certain shaded rays which are diffused through the atmosphere and these vary in character according to that of the primary shadows whence they are derived i shall therefore call these shadows derived shadows because they are produced by other shadows and the third book will treat of these again these derived shadows where they are intercepted by various objects produce effects as various as the places where they are cast and of this i will treat in the fourth book and since all round the derived shadows where the derived shadows are intercepted there is always a space where the light falls and by reflected dispersion is thrown back towards its cause it meets the original shadow and mingles with it and modifies it somewhat in its nature and on this i will compose my fifth book besides this in the sixth book i will investigate the many and various diversities of reflections resulting from these rays which will modify the original shadow by imparting some of the various colours from the different objects whence these reflected rays are derived again the seventh book will treat of the various distances that may exist between the spot where the reflected rays fall and that where they originate and the various shades of colour which they will acquire in falling on opaque bodies different principles and plans of treatment first i will treat of light falling through windows which i will call restricted light and then i will treat of light in the open country to which i will give the name of diffused light then i will treat of the light of luminous bodies of painting the conditions of shadow and light as seen by the eye are of these the first is when the eye and the light are on the same side of the object seen the nd is when the eye is in front of the object and the light is behind it the rd is when the eye is in front of the object and the light is on one side in such a way as that a line drawn from the object to the eye and one from the object to the light should form a right angle where they meet of painting this is another section that is of the nature of a reflection from an object placed between the eye and the light under various aspects of painting as regards all visible objects things must be considered these are the position of the eye which sees that of the object seen with regard to the light and the position of the light which illuminates the object b is the eye a the object seen c the light a is the eye b the illuminating body c is the illuminated object let a be the light b the eye c the object seen by the eye and in the light these show first the eye between the light and the body the nd the light between the eye and the body the rd the body between the eye and the light a is the eye b the illuminated object c the

a window or flame the second is diffused universal light such as we see in cloudy weather or in mist and the like the rd is subdued light that is when the sun is entirely below the horizon either in the evening or morning of light the lights which may illuminate opaque bodies are of kinds these are diffused light as that of the atmosphere within our horizon and direct as that of the sun or of a window or door or other opening the third is reflected light and there is a th which is that which passes through semi transparent bodies as linen or paper or the like but not transparent like glass or crystal or other diaphanous bodies which produce the same effect as though nothing intervened between the shaded object and the light that falls upon it and this we will discuss fully in our discourse definition of the nature of shadows what light and shadow are shadow is the absence of light merely the obstruction of the luminous rays by an opaque body shadow is of the nature of darkness light on an object is of the nature of a luminous body one conceals and the other reveals they are always associated and inseparable from all objects but shadow is a more powerful agent than light for it can impede and entirely deprive bodies of their light while light can never entirely expel shadow from a body that is from an opaque body shadow is the diminution of light by the intervention of an opaque body shadow is the counterpart of the luminous rays which are cut off by an opaque body this is proved because the shadow cast is the same in shape and size as the luminous rays were which are transformed into a shadow shadow is the diminution alike of light and of darkness and stands between darkness and light a shadow may be infinitely dark and also of infinite degrees of absence of darkness the beginnings and ends of shadow lie between the light and darkness and may be infinitely diminished and infinitely increased shadow is the means by which bodies display their form the forms of bodies could not be understood in detail but for shadow of the nature of shadow shadow partakes of the nature of universal matter all such matters are more powerful in their beginning and grow weaker towards the end i say at the beginning whatever their form or condition may be and whether visible or invisible and it is not from small beginnings that they grow to a great size in time as it might be a great oak which has a feeble beginning from a small acorn yet i may say that the oak is most powerful at its beginning that is where it springs from the earth which is where it is largest to return darkness then is the strongest degree of shadow and light is its least therefore o painter make your shadow darkest close to the object that casts it and make the end of it fading into light seeming to have no end of the various kinds of shadows darkness is absence of light shadow is diminution of light primitive shadow is that which is inseparable from a body not in the light derived shadow is that which is disengaged from a body in shadow and pervades the air a cast transparent shadow is that which is surrounded by an illuminated surface a simple shadow is one which receives no light from the luminous body which causes it a simple shadow begins within the line which starts from the edge of the luminous body a b a simple shadow is one where no light at all interferes with it a compound shadow is one which is somewhat illuminated by one or more lights what is the difference between a shadow that is inseparable from a body and a cast shadow an inseparable shadow is that which is never absent from the illuminated body as for instance a ball which so long as it is in the light always has one side in shadow which never leaves it for any movement or change of position in the ball a separate shadow may be and may not be produced by the body itself suppose the ball to be one braccia distant from a wall with a light on the opposite side of it this light will throw upon the wall exactly as broad a shadow as is to be seen on the side of the ball that is turned towards the wall that portion of the cast shadow will not be visible when the light is below the ball and the shadow is thrown up towards the sky and finding no obstruction on its way is lost how there are kinds of light one separable from and the other inseparable from bodies of the various kinds of light separate light is that which falls upon the body inseparable light is the side of the body that is illuminated by that light one is called primary the other derived and in the same way there are two kinds of shadow one primary and the other derived the primary is that which is inseparable from the body the derived is that which proceeds from the body conveying to the surface of the wall the form of the body causing it how there are different kinds of light one being called diffused the other restricted the diffused is that which freely illuminates objects the restricted is that which being admitted through an opening or window illuminates them on that side only footnote at the spot marked a in the first diagram leonardo wrote lume costretto restricted light at the spot b on the second diagram he wrote lume libero diffused light general remarks light is the chaser away of darkness shade is the obstruction of light primary light is that which falls on objects and causes light and shade and derived lights are those portions of a body which are illuminated by the primary light a primary shadow is that side of a body on which the light cannot fall the general distribution of shadow and light is that sum total of the rays thrown off by a shaded or illuminated body passing through the air without any interference and the spot which intercepts and cuts off the distribution of the dark and light rays and the eye can best distinguish the forms of objects when it is placed between the shaded and the illuminated parts memorandum of things i require to have granted as axioms in my explanation of perspective i ask to have this much granted me to assert that every ray passing through air of equal density throughout travels in a straight line from its cause to the object or place it falls upon first book on light and shade on the nature of light the reason by which we know that a light radiates from a single centre is this we plainly see that a large light is often much broader than some small object which nevertheless and although the rays of the large light are much more than twice the extent of the small body always has its shadow cast on the nearest surface very visibly let c f be a broad light and n be the object in front of it casting a shadow on the plane and let a b be the plane it is clear that it is not the broad light that will cast the shadow n on the plane but that the light has within it a centre is shown by this experiment the shadow falls on the plane as is shown at m o t r footnote in the original ms no explanatory text is placed after this title line but a space is left for it and the text beginning at line comes next why to two eyes or in front of two eyes do objects appear as two why when you estimate the direction of an object with two sights the nearer appears confused i say that the eye projects an infinite number of lines which mingle or join those reaching it which come to it from the object looked at and it is only the central and sensible line that can discern and discriminate colours and objects all the others are false and illusory and if you place objects at half an arm s length apart if the nearer of the two is close to the eye its form will remain far more confused than that of the second the reason is that the first is overcome by a greater number of false lines than the second and so is rendered vague light acts in the same manner for in the effects of its lines rays and particularly in perspective it much resembles the eye and its central rays are what cast the true shadow when the object in front of it is too quickly overcome with dim rays it will cast a broad and disproportionate shadow ill defined but when the object which is to cast the shadow and cuts off the rays near to the place where the shadow falls then the shadow is distinct and the more so in proportion as the light is far off because at a long distance the central ray is less overcome by false rays because the lines from the eye and the solar and other luminous rays passing through the atmosphere are obliged to travel in straight lines unless they are deflected by a denser or rarer air when they will be bent at some point but so long as the air is free from grossness or moisture they will preserve their direct course always carrying the image of the object that intercepts them back to their point of origin and if this is the eye the intercepting object will be seen by its colour as well as by form and size but if the intercepting plane has in it some small perforation opening into a darker chamber not darker in colour but by absence of light you will see the rays enter through this hole and transmitting to the plane beyond all the details of the object they proceed from both as to colour and form only every thing will be upside down but the size of the image where the lines are reconstructed will be in proportion to the relative distance of the aperture from the plane on which the lines fall on one hand and from their origin on the other there they intersect and form pyramids with their point meeting a common apex and their bases opposite let a b be the point of origin of the lines d e the first plane and c the aperture with the intersection of the lines f g is the inner plane you will find that a falls upon the inner plane below at g and b which is below will go up to the spot f it will be quite evident to experimenters that every luminous body has in itself a core or centre from which and to which all the lines radiate which are sent forth by the surface of the luminous body and reflected back to it or which having been thrown out and not intercepted are dispersed in the air the rays whether shaded or luminous have greater strength and effect at their points than at their sides although the points of luminous pyramids may extend into shaded places and those of pyramids of shadow into illuminated places and though among the luminous pyramids one may start from a broader base than another nevertheless if by reason of their various length these luminous pyramids acquire angles of equal size their light will be equal and the case will be the same with the pyramids of shadow as may be seen in the intersected pyramids a b c and d e f which though their bases differ in size are equal as to breadth and light footnote this supplementary paragraph is indicated as being a continuation of line by two small crosses the difference between light and lustre of the difference between light and lustre and that lustre is not included among colours but is saturation of whiteness and derived from the surface of wet bodies light partakes of the colour of the object which reflects it to the eye as gold or silver or the like of the highest lights which turn and move as the eye moves which sees the object suppose the body to be the round object figured here and let the light be at the point a and let the illuminated side of the object be b c and the eye at the point d i say that as lustre is every where and complete in each part if you stand at the point d the lustre will appear at c and in proportion as the eye moves from d to a the lustre will move from c to n of painting heigh light or lustre on any object is not situated necessarily in the middle of an illuminated object but moves as and where the eye moves in looking at it of light and lustre what is the difference between light and the lustre which is seen on the polished surface of opaque bodies the lights which are produced from the polished surface of opaque bodies will be stationary on stationary objects even if the eye on which they strike moves but reflected lights will on those same objects appear in as many different places on the surface as different positions are taken by the eye what bodies have light upon them without lustre opaque bodies which have a hard and rough surface never display any lustre in any portion of the side on which the light falls what bodies will display lustre but not look illuminated those bodies which are opaque and hard with a hard surface reflect light lustre from every spot on the illuminated side which is in a position to receive light at the same angle of incidence as they occupy with regard to the eye but as the surface mirrors all the surrounding objects the illuminated body is not recognisable in these portions of the illuminated body the relations of luminous to illuminated bodies the middle of the light and shade on an object in light and shade is opposite to the middle of the primary light all light and shadow expresses itself in pyramidal lines the middle of the shadow on any object must necessarily be opposite the middle of its light with a direct line passing through the centre of the body the middle of the light will be at a that of the shadow at b again in bodies shown in light and shade the middle of each must coincide with the centre of the body and a straight line will pass through both and through that centre footnote in the original ms at the spot marked a of the first diagram leonardo wrote primitiuo and at the spot marked c primitiva primary at the spot marked b he wrote dirivatiuo and at d deriuatiua derived experiments on the relation of light and shadow within a room shows how light from any side converges to one point although the balls a b c are lighted from one window nevertheless if you follow the lines of their shadows you will see they intersect at a point forming the angle n footnote the diagram belonging to this passage is slightly sketched on pl xxxii a square with three balls below it the first three lines of the text belonging to it are written above the sketch and the six others below it every shadow cast by a body has a central line directed to a single point produced by the intersection of luminous lines in the middle of the opening and thickness of the window the proposition stated above is plainly seen by experiment thus if you draw a place with a window looking northwards and let this be s f you will see a line starting from the horizon to the east which touching the angles of the window o f reaches d and from the horizon on the west another line touching the other angles r s and ending at c and their intersection falls exactly in the middle of the opening and thickness of the window again you can still better confirm this proof by placing two sticks as shown at g h and you will see the line drawn from the centre of the shadow directed to the centre m and prolonged to the horizon n f footnote b here stands for cerchio del orizonte tramontano on the original diagram the circle of the horizon towards the north a for levante east and c for ponete west every shadow with all its variations which becomes larger as its distance from the object is greater has its external lines intersecting in the middle between the light and the object this proposition is very evident and is confirmed by experience for if a b is a window without any object interposed the luminous atmosphere to the right hand at a is seen to the left at d and the atmosphere at the left illuminates on the right at c and the lines intersect at the point m footnote a here stands for levante east b for ponente west every body in light and shade is situated between pyramids one dark and the other luminous one is visible the other is not but this only happens when the light enters by a window supposing a b to be the window and r the body in light and shade the light to the right hand z will pass the object to the left and go on to p the light to the left at k will pass to the right of the object at i and go on to m and the two lines will intersect at c and form a pyramid then again a b falls on the shaded body at i g and forms a pyramid f i g f will be dark because the light a b can never fall there i g c will be illuminated because the light falls upon it light and shadow with regard to the position of the eye every shaded body that is larger than the pupil and that interposes between the luminous body and the eye will be seen dark when the eye is placed between the luminous body and the objects illuminated by it these objects will be seen without any shadow footnote the diagram which in the original stands above line is given on plate ii no then after a blank space of about eight lines the diagram plate ii no is placed in the original there is no explanation of it beyond the one line written under it why the lights one on each side of a body having two pyramidal sides of an obtuse apex leave it devoid of shadow footnote the sketch illustrating this is on plate xli no a body in shadow situated between the light and the eye can never display its illuminated portion unless the eye can see the whole of the primary light footnote a stands for corpo body b for lume light the eye which looks at a spot half way between the shadow and the light which surrounds the body in shadow will see that the deepest shadows on that body will meet the eye at equal angles that is at the same angle as that of sight footnote in both these diagrams a stands for lume light b for ombra shadow of the different light and shade in various aspects and of objects placed in them if the sun is in the east and you look towards the west you will see every thing in full light and totally without shadow because you see them from the same side as the sun and if you look towards the south or north you will see all objects in light and shade because you see both the side towards the sun and the side away from it and if you look towards the coming of the sun all objects will show you their shaded side because on that side the sun cannot fall upon them the law of the incidence of light the edges of a window which are illuminated by lights of equal degrees of brightness will not reflect light of equal brightness into the chamber within if b is a candle and a c our hemisphere both will illuminate the edges of the window m n but light b will only illuminate f g and the hemisphere a will light all of d e of painting that part of a body which receives the luminous rays at equal angles will be in a higher light than any other part of it and the part which the luminous rays strike between less equal angles will be less strongly illuminated second book on light and shade gradations of strength in the shadows that portion of a body in light and shade will be least luminous which is seen under the least amount of light that part of the object which is marked m is in the highest light because it faces the window a d by the line a f n is in the second grade because the light b d strikes it by the line b e o is in the third grade as the light falls on it from c d by the line c h p is the lowest light but one as c d falls on it by the line d v q is the deepest shadow for no light falls on it from any part of the window in proportion as c d goes into a d so will n r s be darker than m and all the rest is space without shadow footnote the diagram belonging to this chapter is no on plate iii the letters a b e d and r are not reproduced in facsimile of the original but have been replaced by ordinary type in the margin the original text of these lines is reproduced within the diagram compare no the light which falls on a shaded body at the acutest angle receives the highest light and the darkest portion is that which receives it at an obtuse angle and both the light and the shadow form pyramids the angle c receives the highest grade of light because it is directly in front of the window a b and the whole horizon of the sky m x the angle a differs but little from c because the angles which divide it are not so unequal as those below and only that portion of the horizon is intercepted which lies between y and x although it gains as much on the other side its line is nevertheless not very strong because one angle is smaller than its fellow the angles e i will have less light because they do not see much of the light m s and the light v x and their angles are very unequal yhe angle k and the angle f are each placed between very unequal angles and therefore have but little light because at k it has only the light p t and at f only t q o g is the lowest grade of light because this part has no light at all from the sky and thence come the lines which will reconstruct a pyramid that is the counterpart of the pyramid c and this pyramid l is in the first grade of shadow for this too is placed between equal angles directly opposite to each other on either side of a straight line which passes through the centre of the body and goes to the centre of the light the several luminous images cast within the frame of the window at the points a and b make a light which surrounds the derived shadow cast by the solid body at the points and the shaded images increase from o g and end at and footnote the diagram belonging to this chapter is no on plate iii in the original it is placed between lines and and in the reproduction these are shown in part the semi circle above is marked orizonte horizon the number at the left hand side outside the facsimile is in the place of a figure which has become indistinct in the original on the intensity of shadows as dependent on the distance from the light the smaller the light that falls upon an object the more shadow it will display and the light will illuminate a smaller portion of the object in proportion as it is nearer to it and conversely a larger extent of it in proportion as it is farther off a light which is smaller than the object on which it falls will light up a smaller extent of it in proportion as it is nearer to it and the converse as it is farther from it but when the light is larger than the object illuminated it will light a larger extent of the object in proportion as it is nearer and the converse when they are farther apart that portion of an illuminated object which is nearest to the source of light will be the most strongly illuminated that portion of the primary shadow will be least dark which is farthest from the edges the derived shadow will be darker than the primary shadow where it is contiguous with it on the proportion of light and shade that portion of an opaque body will be more in shade or more in light which is nearer to the dark body by which it is shaded or to the light that illuminates it objects seen in light and shade show in greater relief than those which are wholly in light or in shadow of perspective the shaded and illuminated sides of opaque objects will display the same proportion of light and darkness as their objects footnote the meaning of obbietti objects is explained in no lines between the title line and the next there is in the original a small diagram representing a circle described round a square of painting the outlines and form of any part of a body in light and shade are indistinct in the shadows and in the high lights but in the portions between the light and the shadows they are highly conspicuous of painting among objects in various degrees of shade when the light proceeds from a single source there will be the same proportion in their shadows as in the natural diminution of the light and the same must be understood of the degrees of light a single and distinct luminous body causes stronger relief in the object than a diffused light as may be seen by comparing one side of a landscape illuminated by the sun and one overshadowed by clouds and so illuminated only by the diffused light of the atmosphere third book on light and shade definition of derived shadow derived shadow cannot exist without primary shadow this is proved by the first of this which says darkness is the total absence of light and shadow is an alleviation of darkness and of light and it is more or less dark or light in proportion as the darkness is modified by the light shadow is diminution of light darkness is absence of light shadow is divided into two kinds of which the first is called primary shadow the second is derived shadow the primary shadow is always the basis of the derived shadow the edges of the derived shadow are straight lines footnote the theory of the ombra dirivativa a technical expression for which there is no precise english equivalent is elaborately treated by leonardo but both text and diagrams as pl iv and pl v must at once convince the student that the distinction he makes between ombra primitiva and ombra dirivativa is not merely justifiable but scientific ombra dirivativa is by no means a mere abstract idea this is easily proved by repeating the experiment made by leonardo and by filling with smoke the room in which the existence of the ombra dirivativa is investigated when the shadow becomes visible nor is it difficult to perceive how much of leonardo s teaching depended on this theory the recognised but extremely complicated science of cast shadows percussione dell ombre dirivative as leonardo calls them is thus rendered more intelligible if not actually simpler and we must assume this theory as our chief guide through the investigations which follow the darkness of the derived shadow diminishes in proportion as it is remote from the primary shadow different sorts of derived shadows shadow and light the forms of shadows are three inasmuch as if the solid body which casts the shadow is equal in size to the light the shadow resembles a column without any termination in length if the body is larger than the light the shadow resembles a truncated and inverted pyramid and its length has also no defined termination but if the body is smaller than the light the shadow will resemble a pyramid and come to an end as is seen in eclipses of the moon of simple derived shadows the simple derived shadow is of two kinds one kind which has its length defined and two kinds which are undefined and the defined shadow is pyramidal of the two undefined one is a column and the other spreads out and all three have rectilinear outlines but the converging that is the pyramidal shadow proceeds from a body that is smaller than the light and the columnar from a body equal in size to the light and the spreading shadow from a body larger than the light c of compound derived shadows compound derived shadows are of two kinds that is columnar and spreading of shadow derived shadows are of three kinds of which one is spreading the second columnar the third converging to the point where the two sides meet and intersect and beyond this intersection the sides are infinitely prolonged or straight lines and if you say this shadow must terminate at the angle where the sides meet and extend no farther i deny this because above in the first on shadow i have proved that a thing is completely terminated when no portion of it goes beyond its terminating lines now here in this shadow we see the converse of this in as much as where this derived shadow originates we obviously have the figures of two pyramids of shadow which meet at their angles hence if as my opponent says the first pyramid of shadow terminates the derivative shadow at the angle whence it starts then the second pyramid of shadow so says the adversary must be caused by the angle and not from the body in shadow and this is disproved with the help of the nd of this which says shadow is a condition produced by a body casting a shadow and interposed between this shadow and the luminous body by this it is made clear that the shadow is not produced by the angle of the derived shadow but only by the body casting the shadow c if a spherical solid body is illuminated by a light of elongated form the shadow produced by the longest portion of this light will have less defined outlines than that which is produced by the breadth of the same light and this is proved by what was said before which is that a shadow will have less defined outlines in proportion as the light which causes it is larger and conversely the outlines are clearer in proportion as it is smaller footnote the two diagrams to this chapter are on plate iv no on the relation of derived and primary shadow the derived shadow can never resemble the body from which it proceeds unless the light is of the same form and size as the body causing the shadow the derived shadow cannot be of the same form as the primary shadow unless it is intercepted by a plane parallel to it how a cast shadow can never be of the same size as the body that casts it if the rays of light proceed as experience shows from a single point and are diffused in a sphere round this point radiating and dispersed through the air the farther they spread the wider they must spread and an object placed between the light and a wall is always imaged larger in its shadow because the rays that strike it footnote the following lines are wanting to complete the logical connection would by the time they have reached the wall have become larger any shadow cast by a body in light and shade is of the same nature and character as that which is inseparable from the body the centre of the length of a shadow always corresponds to that of the luminous body footnote this second statement of the same idea as in the former sentence but in different words does not in the original come next to the foregoing sections and are placed between them it is inevitable that every shadow must have its centre in a line with the centre of the light on the shape of derived shadows of the pyramidal shadow the pyramidal shadow produced by a columnar body will be narrower than the body itself in proportion as the simple derived shadow is intersected farther from the body which casts it footnote compare the first diagram to no if we here conceive of the outlines of the pyramid of shadow on the ground as prolonged beyond its apex this gives rise to a second pyramid this is what is spoken of at the beginning of no the cast shadow will be longest when the light is lowest the cast shadow will be shortest when the light is highest both the primary and derived shadow will be larger when caused by the light of a candle than by diffused light the difference between the larger and smaller shadows will be in inverse proportion to the larger and smaller lights causing them footnote in the diagrams a stands for celo sky b for cadela candle all bodies in proportion as they are nearer to or farther from the source of light will produce longer or shorter derived shadows among bodies of equal size that one which is illuminated by the largest light will have the shortest shadow experiment confirms this proposition thus the body m n is surrounded by a larger amount of light than the body p q as is shown above let us say that v c a b d x is the sky the source of light and that s t is a window by which the luminous rays enter and so m n and p q are bodies in light and shade as exposed to this light m n will have a small derived shadow because its original shadow will be small and the derivative light will be large again because the original light c d will be large and p q will have more derived shadow because its original shadow will be larger and its derived light will be smaller than that of the body m n because that portion of the hemisphere a b which illuminates it is smaller than the hemisphere c d which illuminates the body m n footnote the diagram given on pl iv no stands in the original between lines and while the text of lines to is written on its left side in the reproduction of this diagram the letter v at the outer right hand end has been omitted the shadow m bears the same proportion to the shadow n as the line b c to the line f c of painting of different shadows of equal strength that which is nearest the eye will seem the least strong why is the shadow e a b in the first grade of strength b c in the second c d in the third the reason is that as from e a b the sky is nowhere visible it gets no light whatever from the sky and so has no direct primary light b c faces the portion of the sky f g and is illuminated by it c d faces the sky at h k c d being exposed to a larger extent of sky than b c it is reasonable that it should be more lighted and thus up to a certain distance the wall a d will grow lighter for the reasons here given until the darkness of the room overpowers the light from the window when the light of the atmosphere is restricted by an opening and illuminates bodies which cast shadows these bodies being equally distant from the centre of the window that which is most obliquely placed will cast the largest shadow beyond it these bodies standing apart in a room lighted by a single window will have derivative shadows more or less short according as they are more or less opposite to the window among the shadows cast by bodies of equal mass but at unequal distances from the opening by which they are illuminated that shadow will be the longest of the body which is least in the light and in proportion as one body is better illuminated than another its shadow will be shorter than another the proportion n m and e v k bear to r t and v x corresponds with that of the shadow x to and y the reason why those bodies which are placed most in front of the middle of the window throw shorter shadows than those obliquely situated is that the window appears in its proper form and to the obliquely placed ones it appears foreshortened to those in the middle the window shows its full size to the oblique ones it appears smaller the one in the middle faces the whole hemisphere that is e f and those on the side have only a strip that is q r faces a b and m n faces c d the body in the middle having a larger quantity of light than those at the sides is lighted from a point much below its centre and thus the shadow is shorter and the pyramid g goes into l y exactly as often as a b goes into e f the axis of every derivative shadow passes through footnote passa per passes through the meaning of these words is probably this each of the three axes of the derived shadow intersects the centre mezzo of the primary shadow ombra originale and by prolongation upwards crosses six lines this is self evident only in the middle diagram but it is equally true of the side figures if we conceive of the lines f x n v m y l k v and e as prolonged beyond the semicircle of the horizon and is in a straight line with the centre of the primary shadow with the centre of the body casting it and of the derivative light and with the centre of the window and finally with the centre of that portion of the source of light which is the celestial hemisphere y h is the centre of the derived shade l h of the primary shadow l of the body throwing it l k of the derived light v is the centre of the window e is the final centre of the original light afforded by that portion of the hemisphere of the sky which illuminates the solid body footnote compare the diagram on pl iv no in the original this drawing is placed between lines and the rest from line to line is written on the left hand margin the farther the derived shadow is prolonged the lighter it becomes you will find that the proportion of the diameter of the derived shadow to that of the primary shadow will be the same as that between the darkness of the primary shadow and that of the derived shadow footnote compare no let a b be the diameter of the primary shadow and c d that of the derived shadow i say that a b going as you see three times into d c the shadow d c will be three times as light as the shadow a b footnote compare no if the size of the illuminating body is larger than that of the illuminated body an intersection of shadow will occur beyond which the shadows will run off in two opposite directions as if they were caused by two separate lights on the relative intensity of derived shadows on painting the derived shadow is stronger in proportion as it is nearer to its place of origin how shadows fade away at long distances shadows fade and are lost at long distances because the larger quantity of illuminated air which lies between the eye and the object seen tints the shadow with its own colour a b will be darker than c d in proportion as c d is broader than a b footnote in the original ms the word lume light is written at the apex of the pyramid it can be proved why the shadow o p c h is darker in proportion as it is nearer to the line p h and is lighter in proportion as it is nearer to the line o c let the light a b be a window and let the dark wall in which this window is be b s that is one of the sides of the wall then we may say that the line p h is darker than any other part of the space o p c h because this line faces the whole surface in shadow of footnote in the original the diagram is placed between lines and the wall b s the line o c is lighter than the other part of this space o p c h because this line faces the luminous space a b where the shadow is larger or smaller or equal the body which casts it first of the character of divided lights footnote lumi divisi the text here breaks off abruptly of the compound shadow f r c h caused by a single light the shadow f r c h is under such conditions as that where it is farthest from its inner side it loses depth in proportion to prove this let d a be the light and f n the solid body and let a e be one of the side walls of the window that is d a then i say according to the nd proposition that the surface of any body is affected by the tone of the objects surrounding it that the side r c which faces the dark wall a e must participate of its darkness and in the same way that the outer surface which faces the light d a participates of the light thus we get the outlines of the extremes on each side of the centre included between them this is divided into four parts the first the extremes which include the compound shadow secondly the compound shadow between these extremes the action of the light as from its centre if it were the whole of the light that caused the shadows beyond the bodies placed in front of it it would follow that any body much smaller than the light would cast a pyramidal shadow but experience not showing this it must be the centre of the light that produces this effect footnote the diagram belonging to this passage is between lines and in the original comp the reproduction pl iv no the text and drawing of this chapter have already been published with tolerable accuracy see m jordan das malerbuch des leonardo da vinci leipzig p proof let a b be the width of the light from a window which falls on a stick set up at one foot from a c footnote bastone stick the diagram has a sphere in place of a stick and let a d be the space where all the light from the window is visible at c e that part of the window which is between l b cannot be seen in the same way a m cannot be seen from d f and therefore in these two portions the light begins to fail shadow as produced by two lights of different size a body in light and shade placed between two equal lights side by side will cast shadows in proportion to the amount of light and the shadows will be one darker than the other in proportion as one light is nearer to the said body than the other on the opposite side a body placed at an equal distance between two lights will cast two shadows one deeper than the other in proportion as the light which causes it is brighter than the other footnote in the ms the larger diagram is placed above the first line the smaller one between l a light which is smaller than the body it illuminates produces shadows of which the outlines end within the surface of the body and not much compound shadow and falls on less than half of it a light which is larger than the body it illuminates falls on more than half of it and produces much compound shadow the effect of light at different distances of the shadow cast by a body placed between equal lights a body placed between equal lights will cast shadows of itself in the direction of the lines of the lights and if you move this body placing it nearer to one of the lights the shadow cast towards the nearer light will be less deep than that which falls towards the more distant one further complications in the derived shadows the greatest depth of shadow is in the simple derived shadow because it is not lighted by either of the two lights a b c d the next less deep shadow is the derived shadow e f n and in this the shadow is less by half because it is illuminated by a single light that is c d this is uniform in natural tone because it is lighted throughout by one only of the two luminous bodies but it varies with the conditions of shadow inasmuch as the farther it is away from the light the less it is illuminated by it the third degree of depth is the middle shadow footnote we gather from what follows that q g r here means ombra media the middle shadow but this is not uniform in natural tone because the nearer it gets to the simple derived shadow the deeper it is footnote compare lines and it is the uniformly gradual diminution by increase of distance which is what modifies it footnote see footnote that is to say the depth of a shadow increases in proportion to the distance from the two lights the fourth is the shadow k r s and this is all the darker in natural tone in proportion as it is nearer to k s because it gets less of the light a o but by the accident of distance it is rendered less deep because it is nearer to the light c d and thus is always exposed to both lights the fifth is less deep in shadow than either of the others because it is always entirely exposed to one of the lights and to the whole or part of the other and it is less deep in proportion as it is nearer to the two lights and in proportion as it is turned towards the outer side x t because it is more exposed to the second light a b footnote the diagram to this section is given on pl v to the left is the facsimile of the beginning of the text belonging to it of simple shadows why at the intersections a b of the two compound shadows e f and m e is a simple shadow pfoduced as at e h and m g while no such simple shadow is produced at the other two intersections c d made by the very same compound shadows answer compound shadow are a mixture of light and shade and simple shadows are simply darkness hence of the two lights n and o one falls on the compound shadow from one side and the other on the compound shadow from the other side but where they intersect no light falls as at a b therefore it is a simple shadow where there is a compound shadow one light or the other falls and here a difficulty arises for my adversary since he says that where the compound shadows intersect both the lights which produce the shadows must of necessity fall and therefore these shadows ought to be neutralised inasmuch as the two lights do not fall there we say that the shadow is a simple one and where only one of the two lights falls we say the shadow is compound and where both the lights fall the shadow is neutralised for where both lights fall no shadow of any kind is produced but only a light background limiting the shadow here i shall say that what my adversary said was true but he only mentions such truths as are in his favour and if we go on to the rest he must conclude that my proposition is true and that is that if both lights fell on the point of intersection the shadows would be neutralised this i confess to be true if neither of the two shadows fell in the same spot because where a shadow and a light fall a compound shadow is produced and wherever two shadows or two equal lights fall the shadow cannot vary in any part of it the shadows and the lights both being equal and this is proved in the eighth proposition on proportion where it is said that if a given quantity has a single unit of force and resistance a double quantity will have double force and double resistance definition the intersection n is produced by the shadows caused by the light b because this light b produces the shadow x b and the shadow s b but the intersection m is produced by the light a which causes the shadow s a and the shadow x a but if you uncover both the lights a b then you get the two shadows n m both at once and besides these two other simple shadows are produced at r o where neither of the two lights falls at all the grades of depth in compound shadows are fewer in proportion as the lights falling on and crossing them are less numerous why the intersections at n being composed of two compound derived shadows forms a compound shadow and not a simple one as happens with other intersections of compound shadows this occurs according to the nd diagram of this prop which says the intersection of derived shadows when produced by the intersection of columnar shadows caused by a single light does not produce a simple shadow and this is the corollary of the st prop which says the intersection of simple derived shadows never results in a deeper shadow because the deepest shadows all added together cannot be darker than one by itself since if many deepest shadows increased in depth by their duplication they could not be called the deepest shadows but only part shadows but if such intersections are illuminated by a second light placed between the eye and the intersecting bodies then those shadows would become compound shadows and be uniformly dark just as much at the intersection as throughout the rest in the st and nd above the intersections i k will not be doubled in depth as it is doubled in quantity but in this rd at the intersections g n they will be double in depth and in quantity how and when the surroundings in shadow mingle their derived shadow with the light derived from the luminous body the derived shadow of the dark walls on each side of the bright light of the window are what mingle their various degrees of shade with the light derived from the window and these various depths of shade modify every portion of the light except where it is strongest at c to prove this let d a be the primary shadow which is turned towards the point e and darkens it by its derived shadow as may be seen by the triangle a e d in which the angle e faces the darkened base d a e the point v faces the dark shadow a s which is part of a d and as the whole is greater than a part e which faces the whole base of the triangle will be in deeper shadow than v which only faces part of it in consequence of the conclusion shown in the above diagram t will be less darkened than v because the base of the t is part of the base of the v and in the same way it follows that p is less in shadow than t because the base of the p is part of the base of the t and c is the terminal point of the derived shadow and the chief beginning of the highest light footnote the diagram on pl iv no belongs to this passage but it must be noted that the text explains only the figure on the right hand side fourth book on light and shade on the shape of the cast shadows the form of the shadow cast by any body of uniform density can never be the same as that of the body producing it footnote comp the drawing on pi xxviii no no cast shadow can produce the true image of the body which casts it on a vertical plane unless the centre of the light is equally distant from all the edges of that body if a window a b admits the sunlight into a room the sunlight will magnify the size of the window and diminish the shadow of a man in such a way as that when the man makes that dim shadow of himself approach to that which defines the real size of the window he will see the shadows where they come into contact dim and confused from the strength of the light shutting off and not allowing the solar rays to pass the effect of the shadow of the man cast by this contact will be exactly that figured above footnote it is scarcely possible to render the meaning of this sentence with strict accuracy mainly because the grammatical construction is defective in the most important part line in the very slight original sketch the shadow touches the upper arch of the window and the correction here given is perhaps not justified a shadow is never seen as of uniform depth on the surface which intercepts it unless every portion of that surface is equidistant from the luminous body this is proved by the th which says the shadow will appear lighter or stronger as it is surrounded by a darker or a lighter background and by the th of this the background will be in parts darker or lighter in proportion as it is farther from or nearer to the luminous body and of various spots equally distant from the luminous body those will always be in the highest light on which the rays fall at the smallest angles the outline of the shadow as it falls on inequalities in the surface will be seen with all the contours similar to those of the body that casts it if the eye is placed just where the centre of the light was the shadow will look darkest where it is farthest from the body that casts it the shadow c d cast by the body in shadow a b which is equally distant in all parts is not of equal depth because it is seen on a back ground of varying brightness footnote compare the three diagrams on pl vi no which in the original accompany this section on the outlines of cast shadows the edges of a derived shadow will be most distinct where it is cast nearest to the primary shadow as the derived shadow gets more distant from the primary shadow the more the cast shadow differs from the primary shadow of shadows which never come to an end the greater the difference between a light and the body lighted by it the light being the larger the more vague will be the outlines of the shadow of that object the derived shadow will be most confused towards the edges of its interception by a plane where it is remotest from the body casting it what is the cause which makes the outlines of the shadow vague and confused whether it is possible to give clear and definite outlines to the edges of shadows on the relative size of shadows the body which is nearest to the light casts the largest shadow and why if an object placed in front of a single light is very close to it you will see that it casts a very large shadow on the opposite wall and the farther you remove the object from the light the smaller will the image of the shadow become why a shadow larger than the body that produces it becomes out of proportion the disproportion of a shadow which is larger than the body producing it results from the light being smaller than the body so that it cannot be at an equal distance from the edges of the body footnote h ludwig in his edition of the old copies in the vatican library in which this chapter is included under nos and alters this passage as follows quella parte ch e piu propinqua piu cresce che le distanti although the vatican copy agrees with the original ms in having distante in the former and propinque in the latter place this supposed amendment seems to me to invert the facts supposing for instance that on pl xxxi no f is the spot where the light is that illuminates the figure there represented and that the line behind the figure represents a wall on which the shadow of the figure is thrown it is evident that in that case the nearest portion in this case the under part of the thigh is very little magnified in the shadow and the remoter parts for instance the head are more magnified and the portions which are most remote are made larger than the nearer portions for this reason footnote see footnote why a shadow which is larger than the body causing it has ill defined outlines the atmosphere which surrounds a light is almost like light itself for brightness and colour but the farther off it is the more it loses this resemblance an object which casts a large shadow and is near to the light is illuminated both by that light by the luminous atmosphere hence this diffused light gives the shadow ill defined edges a luminous body which is long and narrow in shape gives more confused outlines to the derived shadow than a spherical light and this contradicts the proposition next following a shadow will have its outlines more clearly defined in proportion as it is nearer to the primary shadow or i should say the body casting the shadow footnote the lettering refers to the lower diagram pl xli no the cause of this is the elongated form of the luminous body a c c footnote see footnote effects on cast shadows by the tone of the back ground of modified shadows modified shadows are those which are cast on light walls or other illuminated objects a shadow looks darkest against a light background the outlines of a derived shadow will be clearer as they are nearer to the primary shadow a derived shadow will be most defined in shape where it is intercepted where the plane intercepts it at the most equal angle those parts of a shadow will appear darkest which have darker objects opposite to them and they will appear less dark when they face lighter objects and the larger the light object opposite the more the shadow will be lightened and the larger the surface of the dark object the more it will darken the derived shadow where it is intercepted a disputed proposition of the opinion of some that a triangle casts no shadow on a plane surface certain mathematicians have maintained that a triangle of which the base is turned to the light casts no shadow on a plane and this they prove by saying that no spherical body smaller than the light can reach the middle with the shadow the lines of radiant light are straight lines therefore suppose the light to be g h and the triangle l m n and let the plane be i k they say the light g falls on the side of the triangle l n and the portion of the plane i q thus again h like g falls on the side l m and then on m n and the plane p k and if the whole plane thus faces the lights g h it is evident that the triangle has no shadow and that which has no shadow can cast none this in this case appears credible but if the triangle n p g were not illuminated by the two lights g and h but by i p and g and k neither side is lighted by more than one single light that is i p is invisible to h g and k will never be lighted by g hence p q will be twice as light as the two visible portions that are in shadow footnote this passage is so obscure that it would be rash to offer an explanation several words seem to have been omitted on the relative depth of cast shadows a spot is most in the shade when a large number of darkened rays fall upon it the spot which receives the rays at the widest angle and by darkened rays will be most in the dark a will be twice as dark as b because it originates from twice as large a base at an equal distance a spot is most illuminated when a large number of luminous rays fall upon it d is the beginning of the shadow d f and tinges c but a little d e is half of the shadow d f and gives a deeper tone where it is cast at b than at f and the whole shaded space e gives its tone to the spot a footnote the diagram here referred to is on pl xli no a n will be darker than c r in proportion to the number of times that a b goes into c d the shadow cast by an object on a plane will be smaller in proportion as that object is lighted by feebler rays let d e be the object and d c the plane surface the number of times that d e will go into f g gives the proportion of light at f h to d c the ray of light will be weaker in proportion to its distance from the hole through which it falls fifth book on light and shade principles of reflection of the way in which the shadows cast by objects ought to be defined if the object is the mountain here figured and the light is at the point a i say that from b d and also from c f there will be no light but from reflected rays and this results from the fact that rays of light can only act in straight lines and the same is the case with the secondary or reflected rays the edges of the derived shadow are defined by the hues of the illuminated objects surrounding the luminous body which produces the shadow on reverberation of reverberation reverberation is caused by bodies of a bright nature with a flat and semi opaque surface which when the light strikes upon them throw it back again like the rebound of a ball to the former object where there can be no reflected lights all dense bodies have their surfaces occupied by various degrees of light and shade the lights are of two kinds one called original the other borrowed original light is that which is inherent in the flame of fire or the light of the sun or of the atmosphere borrowed light will be reflected light but to return to the promised definition i say that this luminous reverberation is not produced by those portions of a body which are turned towards darkened objects such as shaded spots fields with grass of various height woods whether green or bare in which though that side of each branch which is turned towards the original light has a share of that light nevertheless the shadows cast by each branch separately are so numerous as well as those cast by one branch on the others that finally so much shadow is the result that the light counts for nothing hence objects of this kind cannot throw any reflected light on opposite objects reflection on water perspective the shadow or object mirrored in water in motion that is to say in small wavelets will always be larger than the external object producing it it is impossible that an object mirrored on water should correspond in form to the object mirrored since the centre of the eye is above the surface of the water this is made plain in the figure here given which demonstrates that the eye sees the surface a b and cannot see it at l f and at r t it sees the surface of the image at r t and does not see it in the real object c d hence it is impossible to see it as has been said above unless the eye itself is situated on the surface of the water as is shown below footnote a stands for ochio eye b for aria air c for acqua water d for cateto cathetus in the original ms the second diagram is placed below line experiments with the mirror the mirror if the illuminated object is of the same size as the luminous body and as that in which the light is reflected the amount of the reflected light will bear the same proportion to the intermediate light as this second light will bear to the first if both bodies are smooth and white describe how it is that no object has its limitation in the mirror but in the eye which sees it in the mirror for if you look at your face in the mirror the part resembles the whole in as much as the part is everywhere in the mirror and the whole is in every part of the same mirror and the same is true of the whole image of any object placed opposite to this mirror c no man can see the image of another man in a mirror in its proper place with regard to the objects because every object falls on the surface of the mirror at equal angles and if the one man who sees the other in the mirror is not in a direct line with the image he will not see it in the place where it really falls and if he gets into the line he covers the other man and puts himself in the place occupied by his image let n o be the mirror b the eye of your friend and d your own eye your friend s eye will appear to you at a and to him it will seem that yours is at c and the intersection of the visual rays will occur at m so that either of you touching m will touch the eye of the other man which shall be open and if you touch the eye of the other man in the mirror it will seem to him that you are touching your own appendix on shadows in movement of the shadow and its motion when two bodies casting shadows and one in front of the other are between a window and the wall with some space between them the shadow of the body which is nearest to the plane of the wall will move if the body nearest to the window is put in transverse motion across the window to prove this let a and b be two bodies placed between the window n m and the plane surface o p with sufficient space between them as shown by the space a b i say that if the body a is moved towards s the shadow of the body b which is at c will move towards d of the motion of shadows the motion of a shadow is always more rapid than that of the body which produces it if the light is stationary to prove this let a be the luminous body and b the body casting the shadow and d the shadow then i say that in the time while the solid body moves from b to c the shadow d will move to e and this proportion in the rapidity of the movements made in the same space of time is equal to that in the length of the space moved over thus given the proportion of the space moved over by the body b to c to that moved over by the shadow d to e the proportion in the rapidity of their movements will be the same but if the luminous body is also in movement with a velocity equal to that of the solid body then the shadow and the body that casts it will move with equal speed and if the luminous body moves more rapidly than the solid body the motion of the shadow will be slower than that of the body casting it but if the luminous body moves more slowly than the solid body then the shadow will move more rapidly than that body sixth book on light and shade the effect of rays passing through holes perspective if you transmit the rays of the sun through a hole in the shape of a star you will see a beautiful effect of perspective in the spot where the sun s rays fall footnote in this and the following chapters of ms c the order of the original paging has been adhered to and is shown in parenthesis leonardo himself has but rarely worked out the subject of these propositions the space left for the purpose has occasionally been made use of for quite different matter even the numerous diagrams most of them very delicately sketched lettered and numbered which occur on these pages are hardly ever explained with the exception of those few which are here given no small hole can so modify the convergence of rays of light as to prevent at a long distance the transmission of the true form of the luminous body causing them it is impossible that rays of light passing through a parallel slit should not display the form of the body causing them since all the effects produced by a luminous body are in fact the reflection of that body the moon shaped like a boat if transmitted through a hole is figured in the surface it falls on as a boatshaped object footnote in the ms a blank space is left after this question why the eye sees bodies at a distance larger than they measure on the vertical plane footnote this chapter taken from another ms may as an exception be placed here as it refers to the same subject as the preceding section on gradation of shadows although the breadth and length of lights and shadow will be narrower and shorter in foreshortening the quality and quantity of the light and shade is not increased nor diminished the function of shade and light when diminished by foreshortening will be to give shadow and to illuminate an object opposite according to the quality and quantity in which they fall on the body in proportion as a derived shadow is nearer to its penultimate extremities the deeper it will appear g z beyond the intersection faces only the part of the shadow marked y z this by intersection takes the shadow from m n but by direct line it takes the shadow a m hence it is twice as deep as g z y x by intersection takes the shadow n o but by direct line the shadow n m a therefore x y is three times as dark as z g x f by intersection faces o b and by direct line o n m a therefore we must say that the shadow between f x will be four times as dark as the shadow z g because it faces four times as much shadow let a b be the side where the primary shadow is and b c the primary light d will be the spot where it is intercepted f g the derived shadow and f e the derived light and this must be at the beginning of the explanation footnote in the original ms the text of no precedes the one given here in the text of no there is a blank space of about four lines between the lines and the diagram given on pl vi no is placed between lines and between lines and there is another space of about three lines and one line left blank between lines and the reader will find the meaning of the whole passage much clearer if he first reads the final lines compare also line of no on relative proportion of light and shadows that part of the surface of a body on which the images reflection from other bodies placed opposite fall at the largest angle will assume their hue most strongly in the diagram below is a larger angle than since its base a n is larger than e n the base of this diagram below should end at a n that portion of the illuminated surface on which a shadow is cast will be brightest which lies contiguous to the cast shadow just as an object which is lighted up by a greater quantity of luminous rays becomes brighter so one on which a greater quantity of shadow falls will be darker let be the side of an illuminated surface surrounding the cast shadow g e and this spot will be lighter than because less shadow falls on it than on since faces only the shadow i n and faces and receives the shadow a e as well as i n which makes it twice as dark and the same thing happens when you put the atmosphere and the sun in the place of shade and light the distribution of shadow originating in and limited by plane surfaces placed near to each other equal in tone and directly opposite will be darker at the ends than at the beginning which will be determined by the incidence of the luminous rays you will find the same proportion in the depth of the derived shadows a n as in the nearness of the luminous bodies m b which cause them and if the luminous bodies were of equal size you would still farther find the same proportion in the light cast by the luminous circles and their shadows as in the distance of the said luminous bodies footnote the diagram originally placed between lines and is on pl vi no in the diagram given above line of the original and here printed in the text the words corpo luminoso luminous body are written in the circle m luminoso in the circle b and ombroso body in shadow in the circle o that part of the reflection will be brightest where the reflected rays are shortest the darkness occasioned by the casting of combined shadows will be in conformity with its cause which will originate and terminate between two plane surfaces near together alike in tone and directly opposite each other in proportion as the source of light is larger the luminous and shadow rays will be more mixed together this result is produced because wherever there is a larger quantity of luminous rays there is most light but where there are fewer there is least light consequently the shadow rays come in and mingle with them footnote diagrams are inserted before lines and in all the proportions i lay down it must be understood that the medium between the bodies is always the same the smaller the luminous body the more distinct will the transmission of the shadows be when of two opposite shadows produced by the same body one is twice as dark as the other though similar in form one of the two lights causing them must have twice the diameter that the other has and be at twice the distance from the opaque body if the object is lowly moved across the luminous body and the shadow is intercepted at some distance from the object there will be the same relative proportion between the motion of the derived shadow and the motion of the primary shadow as between the distance from the object to the light and that from the object to the spot where the shadow is intercepted so that though the object is moved slowly the shadow moves fast footnote there are diagrams inserted before lines and but they are not reproduced here the diagram above line is written upon as follows at a lume light at b obbietto body at c ombra d obbietto shadow of the object a luminous body will appear less brilliant when surrounded by a bright background i have found that the stars which are nearest to the horizon look larger than the others because light falls upon them from a larger proportion of the solar body than when they are above us and having more light from the sun they give more light and the bodies which are most luminous appear the largest as may be seen by the sun through a mist and overhead it appears larger where there is no mist and diminished through mist no portion of the luminous body is ever visible from any spot within the pyramid of pure derived shadow footnote between lines and there is in the original a large diagram which does not refer to this text a body on which the solar rays fall between the thin branches of trees far apart will cast but a single shadow if an opaque body and a luminous one are both spherical the base of the pyramid of rays will bear the same proportion to the luminous body as the base of the pyramid of shade to the opaque body when the transmitted shadow is intercepted by a plane surface placed opposite to it and farther away from the luminous body than from the object which casts it it will appear proportionately darker and the edges more distinct footnote the diagram which in the original is placed above line is similar to the one here given on page section the diagram here given in the margin stands in the original between lines and a body illuminated by the solar rays passing between the thick branches of trees will produce as many shadows as there are branches between the sun and itself where the shadow rays from an opaque pyramidal body are intercepted they will cast a shadow of bifurcate outline and various depth at the points a light which is broader than the apex but narrower than the base of an opaque pyramidal body placed in front of it will cause that pyramid to cast a shadow of bifurcate form and various degrees of depth if an opaque body smaller than the light casts two shadows and if it is the same size or larger casts but one it follows that a pyramidal body of which part is smaller part equal to and part larger than the luminous body will cast a bifurcate shadow footnote between lines and there are in the original two large diagrams iv perspective of disappearance the theory of the prospettiva de perdimenti would in many important details be quite unintelligible if it had not been led up by the principles of light and shade on which it is based the word prospettiva in the language of the time included the principles of optics what leonardo understood by perdimenti will be clearly seen in the early chapters nos it is in the very nature of the case that the farther explanations given in the subsequent chapters must be limited to general rules the sections given as on indistinctness at short distances have it is true only an indirect bearing on the subject but on the other hand the following chapters on indistinctness at great distances go fully into the matter and in chapters which treat of the importance of light and shade in the perspective of disappearance the practical issues are distinctly insisted on in their relation to the theory this is naturally followed by the statements as to the effect of light or dark backgrounds on the apparent size of bodies nos at the end i have placed in the order of the original those sections from the ms c which treat of the perspective of disappearance and serve to some extent to complete the treatment of the subject definition of the diminished distinctness of the outlines of opaque bodies if the real outlines of opaque bodies are indistinguishable at even a very short distance they will be more so at long distances and since it is by its outlines that we are able to know the real form of any opaque body when by its remoteness we fail to discern it as a whole much more must we fail to discern its parts and outlines of the diminution in perspective of opaque objects among opaque objects of equal size the apparent diminution of size will be in proportion to their distance from the eye of the spectator but it is an inverse proportion since where the distance is greater the opaque body will appear smaller and the less the distance the larger will the object appear and this is the fundamental principle of linear perspective and it follows every object as it becomes more remote loses first those parts which are smallest thus of a horse we should lose the legs before the head because the legs are thinner than the head and the neck before the body for the same reason hence it follows that the last part of the horse which would be discernible by the eye would be the mass of the body in an oval form or rather in a cylindrical form and this would lose its apparent thickness before its length according to the nd rule given above c footnote compare line if the eye remains stationary the perspective terminates in the distance in a point but if the eye moves in a straight horizontal line the perspective terminates in a line and the reason is that this line is generated by the motion of the point and our sight therefore it follows that as we move our sight eye the point moves and as we move the point the line is generated c an illustration by experiment every visible body in so far as it affects the eye includes three attributes that is to say mass form and colour and the mass is recognisable at a greater distance from the place of its actual existence than either colour or form again colour is discernible at a greater distance than form but this law does not apply to luminous bodies the above proposition is plainly shown and proved by experiment because if you see a man close to you you discern the exact appearance of the mass and of the form and also of the colouring if he goes to some distance you will not recognise who he is because the character of the details will disappear if he goes still farther you will not be able to distinguish his colouring but he will appear as a dark object and still farther he will appear as a very small dark rounded object it appears rounded because distance so greatly diminishes the various details that nothing remains visible but the larger mass and the reason is this we know very well that all the images of objects reach the senses by a small aperture in the eye hence if the whole horizon a d is admitted through such an aperture the object b c being but a very small fraction of this horizon what space can it fill in that minute image of so vast a hemisphere and because luminous bodies have more power in darkness than any others it is evident that as the chamber of the eye is very dark as is the nature of all colored cavities the images of distant objects are confused and lost in the great light of the sky and if they are visible at all appear dark and black as every small body must when seen in the diffused light of the atmosphere footnote the diagram belonging to this passage is placed between lines and it is no on pl vi a guiding rule of the atmosphere that interposes between the eye and visible objects an object will appear more or less distinct at the same distance in proportion as the atmosphere existing between the eye and that object is more or less clear hence as i know that the greater or less quantity of the air that lies between the eye and the object makes the outlines of that object more or less indistinct you must diminish the definiteness of outline of those objects in proportion to their increasing distance from the eye of the spectator an experiment when i was once in a place on the sea at an equal distance from the shore and the mountains the distance from the shore looked much greater than that from the mountains on indistinctness at short distances if you place an opaque object in front of your eye at a distance of four fingers breadth if it is smaller than the space between the two eyes it will not interfere with your seeing any thing that may be beyond it no object situated beyond another object seen by the eye can be concealed by this nearer object if it is smaller than the space from eye to eye the eye cannot take in a luminous angle which is too close to it that part of a surface will be better lighted on which the light falls at the greater angle and that part on which the shadow falls at the greatest angle will receive from those rays least of the benefit of the light of the eye the edges of an object placed in front of the pupil of the eye will be less distinct in proportion as they are closer to the eye this is shown by the edge of the object n placed in front of the pupil d in looking at this edge the pupil also sees all the space a c which is beyond the edge and the images the eye receives from that space are mingled with the images of the edge so that one image confuses the other and this confusion hinders the pupil from distinguishing the edge the outlines of objects will be least clear when they are nearest to the eye and therefore remoter outlines will be clearer among objects which are smaller than the pupil of the eye those will be less distinct which are nearer to the eye on indistinctness at great distances objects near to the eye will appear larger than those at a distance objects seen with two eyes will appear rounder than if they are seen with only one objects seen between light and shadow will show the most relief of painting our true perception of an object diminishes in proportion as its size is diminished by distance perspective why objects seen at a distance appear large to the eye and in the image on the vertical plane they appear small perspective i ask how far away the eye can discern a non luminous body as for instance a mountain it will be very plainly visible if the sun is behind it and could be seen at a greater or less distance according to the sun s place in the sky footnote the clue to the solution of this problem lines is given in lines no objects seen with both eyes appear solid since they are seen from two distinct points of sight separated by the distance between the eyes but this solidity cannot be represented in a flat drawing compare no the importance of light and shade in the perspective of disappearance an opaque body seen in a line in which the light falls will reveal no prominences to the eye for instance let a be the solid body and c the light c m and c n will be the lines of incidence of the light that is to say the lines which transmit the light to the object a the eye being at the point b i say that since the light c falls on the whole part m n the portions in relief on that side will all be illuminated hence the eye placed at c cannot see any light and shade and not seeing it every portion will appear of the same tone therefore the relief in the prominent or rounded parts will not be visible of painting when you represent in your work shadows which you can only discern with difficulty and of which you cannot distinguish the edges so that you apprehend them confusedly you must not make them sharp or definite lest your work should have a wooden effect of painting you will observe in drawing that among the shadows some are of undistinguishable gradation and form as is shown in the rd proposition which says rounded surfaces display as many degrees of light and shade as there are varieties of brightness and darkness reflected from the surrounding objects of light and shade you who draw from nature look carefully at the extent the degree and the form of the lights and shadows on each muscle and in their position lengthwise observe towards which muscle the axis of the central line is directed an object which is so brilliantly illuminated as to be almost as bright as light will be visible at a greater distance and of larger apparent size than is natural to objects so remote the effect of light or dark backgrounds on the apparent size of objects a shadow will appear dark in proportion to the brilliancy of the light surrounding it and conversely it will be less conspicuous where it is seen against a darker background of ordinary perspective an object of equal breadth and colour throughout seen against a background of various colours will appear unequal in breadth and if an object of equal breadth throughout but of various colours is seen against a background of uniform colour that object will appear of various breadth and the more the colours of the background or of the object seen against the ground vary the greater will the apparent variations in the breadth be though the objects seen against the ground be of equal breadth throughout a dark object seen against a bright background will appear smaller than it is a light object will look larger when it is seen against a background darker than itself of light a luminous body when obscured by a dense atmosphere will appear smaller as may be seen by the moon or sun veiled by mists of light of several luminous bodies of equal size and brilliancy and at an equal distance that will look the largest which is surrounded by the darkest background of light i find that any luminous body when seen through a dense and thick mist diminishes in proportion to its distance from the eye thus it is with the sun by day as well as the moon and the other eternal lights by night and when the air is clear these luminaries appear larger in proportion as they are farther from the eye that portion of a body of uniform breadth which is against a lighter background will look narrower than the rest e is a given object itself dark and of uniform breadth a b and c d are two backgrounds one darker than the other b c is a bright background as it might be a spot lighted by the sun through an aperture in a dark room then i say that the object e g will appear larger at e f than at g h because e f has a darker background than g h and again at f g it will look narrower from being seen by the eye o on the light background b c footnote the diagram to which the text lines refers is placed in the original between lines and and is given on pl xli no lines to are explained by the lower of the two diagrams on pl xli no in the original these are placed after line that part of a luminous body of equal breadth and brilliancy throughout will look largest which is seen against the darkest background and the luminous body will seem on fire why bodies in light and shade have their outlines altered by the colour and brightness of the objects serving as a background to them if you look at a body of which the illuminated portion lies and ends against a dark background that part of the light which will look brightest will be that which lies against the dark background at d but if this brighter part lies against a light background the edge of the object which is itself light will be less distinct than before and the highest light will appear to be between the limit of the background m f and the shadow the same thing is seen with regard to the dark side inasmuch as that edge of the shaded portion of the object which lies against a light background as at l it looks much darker than the rest but if this shadow lies against a dark background the edge of the shaded part will appear lighter than before and the deepest shade will appear between the edge and the light at the point o footnote in the original diagram o is inside the shaded surface at the level of d an opaque body will appear smaller when it is surrounded by a highly luminous background and a light body will appear larger when it is seen against a darker background this may be seen in the height of buildings at night when lightning flashes behind them it suddenly seems when it lightens as though the height of the building were diminished for the same reason such buildings look larger in a mist or by night than when the atmosphere is clear and light on light between shadows when you are drawing any object remember in comparing the grades of light in the illuminated portions that the eye is often deceived by seeing things lighter than they are and the reason lies in our comparing those parts with the contiguous parts since if two separate parts are in different grades of light and if the less bright is conterminous with a dark portion and the brighter is conterminous with a light background as the sky or something equally bright then that which is less light or i should say less radiant will look the brighter and the brighter will seem the darker of objects equally dark in themselves and situated at a considerable and equal distance that will look the darkest which is farthest above the earth to prove how it is that luminous bodies appear larger at a distance than they are if you place two lighted candles side by side half a braccio apart and go from them to a distance braccia you will see that by the increased size of each they will appear as a single luminous body with the light of the two flames one braccio wide to prove how you may see the real size of luminous bodies if you wish to see the real size of these luminous bodies take a very thin board and make in it a hole no bigger than the tag of a lace and place it as close to your eye as possible so that when you look through this hole at the said light you can see a large space of air round it then by rapidly moving this board backwards and forwards before your eye you will see the light increase and diminish propositions on perspective of disappearance from ms c of several bodies of equal size and equally distant from the eye those will look the smallest which are against the lightest background every visible object must be surrounded by light and shade a perfectly spherical body surrounded by light and shade will appear to have one side larger than the other in proportion as one is more highly lighted than the other perspective no visible object can be well understood and comprehended by the human eye excepting from the difference of the background against which the edges of the object terminate and by which they are bounded and no object will appear to stand out separate from that background so far as the outlines of its borders are concerned the moon though it is at a great distance from the sun when in an eclipse it comes between our eyes and the sun appears to the eyes of men to be close to the sun and affixed to it because the sun is then the background to the moon a luminous body will appear more brilliant in proportion as it is surrounded by deeper shadow footnote the diagram which in the original is placed after this text has no connection with it the straight edges of a body will appear broken when they are conterminous with a dark space streaked with rays of light footnote here again the diagrams in the original have no connection with the text of several bodies all equally large and equally distant that which is most brightly illuminated will appear to the eye nearest and largest footnote here again the diagrams in the original have no connection with the text if several luminous bodies are seen from a great distance although they are really separate they will appear united as one body if several objects in shadow standing very close together are seen against a bright background they will appear separated by wide intervals of several bodies of equal size and tone that which is farthest will appear the lightest and smallest of several objects equal in size brightness of background and length that which has the flattest surface will look the largest a bar of iron equally thick throughout and of which half is red hot affords an example for the red hot part looks thicker than the rest of several bodies of equal size and length and alike in form and in depth of shade that will appear smallest which is surrounded by the most luminous background different portions of a wall surface will be darker or brighter in proportion as the light or shadow falls on them at a larger angle the foregoing proposition can be clearly proved in this way let us say that m q is the luminous body then f g will be the opaque body and let a e be the above mentioned plane on which the said angles fall showing plainly the nature and character of their bases then a will be more luminous than b the base of the angle a is larger than that of b and it therefore makes a greater angle which will be a m q and the pyramid b p m will be narrower and m o c will be still finer and so on by degrees in proportion as they are nearer to e the pyramids will become narrower and darker that portion of the wall will be the darkest where the breadth of the pyramid of shadow is greater than the breadth of the pyramid of light at the point a the pyramid of light is equal in strength to the pyramid of shadow because the base f g is equal to the base r f at the point d the pyramid of light is narrower than the pyramid of shadow by so much as the base s f is less than the base f g divide the foregoing proposition into two diagrams one with the pyramids of light and shadow the other with the pyramids of light only among shadows of equal depth those which are nearest to the eye will look least deep the more brilliant the light given by a luminous body the deeper will the shadows be cast by the objects it illuminates v theory of colours leonardo s theory of colours is even more intimately connected with his principles of light and shade than his perspective of disappearance and is in fact merely an appendix or supplement to those principles as we gather from the titles to sections and while others again nos are headed prospettiva a very few of these chapters are to be found in the oldest copies and editions of the treatise on painting and although the material they afford is but meager and the connection between them but slight we must still attribute to them a special theoretical value as well as practical utility all the more so because our knowledge of the theory and use of colours at the time of the renaissance is still extremely limited the reciprocal effects of colours on objects placed opposite each other of painting the hue of an illuminated object is affected by that of the luminous body of shadow the surface of any opaque body is affected by the colour of surrounding objects a shadow is always affected by the colour of the surface on which it is cast an image produced in a mirror is affected by the colour of the mirror of light and shade every portion of the surface of a body is varied in hue by the reflected colour of the object that may be opposite to it example if you place a spherical body between various objects that is to say with direct sunlight on one side of it and on the other a wall illuminated by the sun which wall may be green or of any other colour while the surface on which it is placed may be red and the two lateral sides are in shadow you will see that the natural colour of that body will assume something of the hue reflected from those objects the strongest will be given by the luminous body the second by the illuminated wall the third by the shadows there will still be a portion which will take a tint from the colour of the edges the surface of every opaque body is affected by the colour of the objects surrounding it but this effect will be strong or weak in proportion as those objects are more or less remote and more or less strongly coloured of painting the surface of every opaque body assumes the hues reflected from surrounding objects the surface of an opaque body assumes the hues of surrounding objects more strongly in proportion as the rays that form the images of those objects strike the surface at more equal angles and the surface of an opaque body assumes a stronger hue from the surrounding objects in proportion as that surface is whiter and the colour of the object brighter or more highly illuminated of the rays which convey through the air the images of objects all the minutest parts of the image intersect each other without interfering with each other to prove this let r be one of the sides of the hole opposite to which let s be the eye which sees the lower end o of the line n o the other extremity cannot transmit its image to the eye s as it has to strike the end r and it is the same with regard to m at the middle of the line the case is the same with the upper extremity n and the eye u and if the end n is red the eye u on that side of the holes will not see the green colour of o but only the red of n according to the th of this where it is said every form projects images from itself by the shortest line which necessarily is a straight line c footnote this probably refers to the diagram given under no of painting the surface of a body assumes in some degree the hue of those around it the colours of illuminated objects are reflected from the surfaces of one to the other in various spots according to the various positions of those objects let o be a blue object in full light facing all by itself the space b c on the white sphere a b e d e f and it will give it a blue tinge m is a yellow body reflected onto the space a b at the same time as o the blue body and they give it a green colour by the nd proposition of this which shows that blue and yellow make a beautiful green c and the rest will be set forth in the book on painting in that book it will be shown that by transmitting the images of objects and the colours of bodies illuminated by sunlight through a small round perforation and into a dark chamber onto a plane surface which itself is quite white c but every thing will be upside down combination of different colours in cast shadows that which casts the shadow does not face it because the shadows are produced by the light which causes and surrounds the shadows the shadow caused by the light e which is yellow has a blue tinge because the shadow of the body a is cast upon the pavement at b where the blue light falls and the shadow produced by the light d which is blue will be yellow at c because the yellow light falls there and the surrounding background to these shadows b c will besides its natural colour assume a hue compounded of yellow and blue because it is lighted by the yellow light and by the blue light both at once shadows of various colours as affected by the lights falling on them that light which causes the shadow does not face it footnote in the original diagram we find in the circle e giallo yellow and the cirle d azurro blue and also under the circle of shadow to the left giallo is written and under that to the right azurro in the second diagram where four circles are placed in a row we find written beginning at the left hand giallo yellow azurro blue verde green rosso red the effect of colours in the camera obscura the edges of a colour ed object transmitted through a small hole are more conspicuous than the central portions the edges of the images of whatever colour which are transmitted through a small aperture into a dark chamber will always be stronger than the middle portions of the intersections of the images in the pupil of the eye the intersections of the images as they enter the pupil do not mingle in confusion in the space where that intersection unites them as is evident since if the rays of the sun pass through two panes of glass in close contact of which one is blue and the other yellow the rays in penetrating them do not become blue or yellow but a beautiful green and the same thing would happen in the eye if the images which were yellow or green should mingle where they meet and intersect as they enter the pupil as this does not happen such a mingling does not exist of the nature of the rays composed of the images of objects and of their intersections the directness of the rays which transmit the forms and colours of the bodies whence they proceed does not tinge the air nor can they affect each other by contact where they intersect they affect only the spot where they vanish and cease to exist because that spot faces and is faced by the original source of these rays and no other object which surrounds that original source can be seen by the eye where these rays are cut off and destroyed leaving there the spoil they have conveyed to it and this is proved by the th proposition on the colour of bodies which says the surface of every opaque body is affected by the colour of surrounding objects hence we may conclude that the spot which by means of the rays which convey the image faces and is faced by the cause of the image assumes the colour of that object on the colours of derived shadows any shadow cast by an opaque body smaller than the light causing the shadow will throw a derived shadow which is tinged by the colour of the light let n be the source of the shadow e f it will assume its hue let o be the source of h e which will in the same way be tinged by its hue and so also the colour of v h will be affected by p which causes it and the shadow of the triangle z k y will be affected by the colour of q because it is produced by it in proportion as c d goes into a d will n r s be darker than m and the rest of the space will be shadowless f g is the highest light because here the whole light of the window a d falls and thus on the opaque body m e is in equally high light z k y is a triangle which includes the deepest shadow because the light a d cannot reach any part of it x h is the nd grade of shadow because it receives only of the light from the window that is c d the third grade of shadow is h e where two thirds of the light from the window is visible the last grade of shadow is b d e f because the highest grade of light from the window falls at f footnote the diagram pl iii no belongs to this chapter as well as the text given in no lines compare lines of no which are written within the diagram evidently apply to both sections and have therefore been inserted in both of the colours of simple derived shadows the colour of derived shadows is always affected by that of the body towards which they are cast to prove this let an opaque body be placed between the plane s c t d and the blue light d e and the red light a b then i say that d e the blue light will fall on the whole surface s c t d excepting at o p which is covered by the shadow of the body q r as is shown by the straight lines d q o e r p and the same occurs with the light a b which falls on the whole surface s c t d excepting at the spot obscured by the shadow q r as is shown by the lines d q o and e r p hence we may conclude that the shadow n m is exposed to the blue light d e but as the red light a b cannot fall there n m will appear as a blue shadow on a red background tinted with blue because on the surface s c t d both lights can fall but in the shadows only one single light falls for this reason these shadows are of medium depth since if no light whatever mingled with the shadow it would be of the first degree of darkness c but in the shadow at o p the blue light does not fall because the body q r interposes and intercepts it there only the red light a b falls there and tinges the shadow of a red hue and so a ruddy shadow appears on the background of mingled red and blue the shadow of q r at o p is red being caused by the blue light d e and the shadow of q r at o p is blue being caused by the red light a b hence we say that the blue light in this instance causes a red derived shadow from the opaque body q r while the red light causes the same body to cast a blue derived shadow but the primary shadow on the dark side of the body itself is not of either of those hues but a mixture of red and blue the derived shadows will be equal in depth if they are produced by lights of equal strength and at an equal distance this is proved footnote the text is unfinished in the original footnote in the original diagram leonardo has written within the circle q r corpo obroso body in shadow at the spot marked a luminoso azzurro blue luminous body at b luminoso rosso red luminous body at e we read ombra azzurra blue tinted shadow and at d ombra rossa red tinted shadow on the nature of colours no white or black is transparent of painting footnote see footnote since white is not a colour but the neutral recipient of every colour footnote il bianco non e colore ma e inpotentia ricettiva d ogni colore white is not a colour but the neutral recipient of every colour leon batt alberti della pittura libro i asserts on the contrary il bianco e l nero non sono veri colori ma sono alteratione delli altri colori ed janitschek p vienna when it is seen in the open air and high up all its shadows are bluish and this is caused according to the th prop which says the surface of every opaque body assumes the hue of the surrounding objects now this white body being deprived of the light of the sun by the interposition of some body between the sun and itself all that portion of it which is exposed to the sun and atmosphere assumes the colour of the sun and atmosphere the side on which the sun does not fall remains in shadow and assumes the hue of the atmosphere and if this white object did not reflect the green of the fields all the way to the horizon nor get the brightness of the horizon itself it would certainly appear simply of the same hue as the atmosphere on gradations in the depth of colours since black when painted next to white looks no blacker than when next to black and white when next to black looks no whiter than white as is seen by the images transmitted through a small hole or by the edges of any opaque screen of colours of several colours all equally white that will look whitest which is against the darkest background and black will look intensest against the whitest background and red will look most vivid against the yellowest background and the same is the case with all colours when surrounded by their strongest contrasts on the reflection of colours perspective every object devoid of colour in itself is more or less tinged by the colour of the object placed opposite this may be seen by experience inasmuch as any object which mirrors another assumes the colour of the object mirrored in it and if the surface thus partially coloured is white the portion which has a red reflection will appear red or any other colour whether bright or dark perspective every opaque and colourless body assumes the hue of the colour reflected on it as happens with a white wall perspective that side of an object in light and shade which is towards the light transmits the images of its details more distinctly and immediately to the eye than the side which is in shadow perspective the solar rays reflected on a square mirror will be thrown back to distant objects in a circular form perspective any white and opaque surface will be partially coloured by reflections from surrounding objects footnote the title line of these chapters is in the original simply pro which may be an abbreviation for either propositione or prospettiva taking prospettiva of course in its widest sense as we often find it used in leonardo s writings the title pro has here been understood to mean prospettiva in accordance with the suggestion afforded by page b of this same ms where the first section is headed prospettiva in full see no while the four following sections are headed merely pro see no what portion of a coloured surface ought in reason to be the most intense if a is the light and b illuminated by it in a direct line c on which the light cannot fall is lighted only by reflection from b which let us say is red hence the light reflected from it will be affected by the hue of the surface causing it and will tinge the surface c with red and if c is also red you will see it much more intense than b and if it were yellow you would see there a colour between yellow and red on the use of dark and light colours in painting why beautiful colours must be in the highest light since we see that the quality of colour is known only by means of light it is to be supposed that where there is most light the true character of a colour in light will be best seen and where there is most shadow the colour will be affected by the tone of that hence o painter remember to show the true quality of colours in bright lights an object represented in white and black will display stronger relief than in any other way hence i would remind you o painter to dress your figures in the lightest colours you can since if you put them in dark colours they will be in too slight relief and inconspicuous from a distance and the reason is that the shadows of all objects are dark and if you make a dress dark there is little variety in the lights and shadows while in light colours there are many grades of painting colours seen in shadow will display more or less of their natural brilliancy in proportion as they are in fainter or deeper shadow but if these same colours are situated in a well lighted place they will appear brighter in proportion as the light is more brilliant the adversary the variety of colours in shadow must be as great as that of the colours in the objects in that shadow the answer colours seen in shadow will display less variety in proportion as the shadows in which they lie are deeper and evidence of this is to be had by looking from an open space into the doorways of dark and shadowy churches where the pictures which are painted in various colours all look of uniform darkness hence at a considerable distance all the shadows of different colours will appear of the same darkness it is the light side of an object in light and shade which shows the true colour on the colours of the rainbow treat of the rainbow in the last book on painting but first write the book on colours produced by the mixture of other colours so as to be able to prove by those painters colours how the colours of the rainbow are produced whether the colours of the rainbow are produced by the sun the colours of the rainbow are not produced by the sun for they occur in many ways without the sunshine as may be seen by holding a glass of water up to the eye when in the glass where there are those minute bubbles always seen in coarse glass each bubble even though the sun does not fall on it will produce on one side all the colours of the rainbow as you may see by placing the glass between the day light and your eye in such a way as that it is close to the eye while on one side the glass admits the diffused light of the atmosphere and on the other side the shadow of the wall on one side of the window either left or right it matters not which then by turning the glass round you will see these colours all round the bubbles in the glass c and the rest shall be said in its place that the eye has no part in producing the colours of the rainbow in the experiment just described the eye would seem to have some share in the colours of the rainbow since these bubbles in the glass do not display the colours except through the medium of the eye but if you place the glass full of water on the window sill in such a position as that the outer side is exposed to the sun s rays you will see the same colours produced in the spot of light thrown through the glass and upon the floor in a dark place below the window and as the eye is not here concerned in it we may evidently and with certainty pronounce that the eye has no share in producing them of the colours in the feathers of certain birds there are many birds in various regions of the world on whose feathers we see the most splendid colours produced as they move as we see in our own country in the feathers of peacocks or on the necks of ducks or pigeons c again on the surface of antique glass found underground and on the roots of turnips kept for some time at the bottom of wells or other stagnant waters we see that each root displays colours similar to those of the real rainbow they may also be seen when oil has been placed on the top of water and in the solar rays reflected from the surface of a diamond or beryl again through the angular facet of a beryl every dark object against a background of the atmosphere or any thing else equally pale coloured is surrounded by these rainbow colours between the atmosphere and the dark body and in many other circumstances which i will not mention as these suffice for my purpose vi prospettiva de colri perspective of colour and prospettiva aerea aerial perspective leonardo distinctly separates these branches of his subject as may be seen in the beginning of no attempts have been made to cast doubts on the results which leonardo arrived at by experiment on the perspective of colour but not with justice as may be seen from the original text of section the question as to the composition of the atmosphere which is inseparable from a discussion on aerial perspective forms a separate theory which is treated at considerable length indeed the author enters into it so fully that we cannot escape the conviction that he must have dwelt with particular pleasure on this part of his subject and that he attached great importance to giving it a character of general applicability general rules the variety of colour in objects cannot be discerned at a great distance excepting in those parts which are directly lighted up by the solar rays as to the colours of objects at long distances no difference is perceptible in the parts in shadow of the visibility of colours which colour strikes most an object at a distance is most conspicuous when it is lightest and the darkest is least visible an exceptional case of the edges outlines of shadows some have misty and ill defined edges others distinct ones no opaque body can be devoid of light and shade except it is in a mist on ground covered with snow or when snow is falling on the open country which has no light on it and is surrounded with darkness and this occurs only in spherical bodies because in other bodies which have limbs and parts those sides of limbs which face each other reflect on each other the accidental hue and tone of their surface an experiment all colours are at a distance undistinguishable and undiscernible all colours at a distance are undistinguishable in shadow because an object which is not in the highest light is incapable of transmitting its image to the eye through an atmosphere more luminous than itself since the lesser brightness must be absorbed by the greater for instance we in a house can see that all the colours on the surface of the walls are clearly and instantly visible when the windows of the house are open but if we were to go out of the house and look in at the windows from a little distance to see the paintings on those walls instead of the paintings we should see an uniform deep and colourless shadow the practice of the prospettiva de colori how a painter should carry out the perspective of colour in practice in order to put into practice this perspective of the variation and loss or diminution of the essential character of colours observe at every hundred braccia some objects standing in the landscape such as trees houses men and particular places then in front of the first tree have a very steady plate of glass and keep your eye very steady and then on this plate of glass draw a tree tracing it over the form of that tree then move it on one side so far as that the real tree is close by the side of the tree you have drawn then colour your drawing in such a way as that in colour and form the two may be alike and that both if you close one eye seem to be painted on the glass and at the same distance then by the same method represent a second tree and a third with a distance of a hundred braccia between each and these will serve as a standard and guide whenever you work on your own pictures wherever they may apply and will enable you to give due distance in those works but i have found that as a rule the second is of the first when it is braccia beyond it footnote this chapter is one of those copied in the manuscript of the vatican library urbinas and the original text is rendered here with no other alterations but in the orthography h ludwig in his edition of this copy translates lines and thus ich finde aber als regel dass der zweite um vier funftel des ersten abnimmt wenn er namlich zwanzig ellen vom ersten entfernt ist he adds in his commentary das ende der nummer ist wohl jedenfalls verstummelt however the translation given above shows that it admits of a different rendering the rules of aerial perspective of aerial perspective there is another kind of perspective which i call aerial perspective because by the atmosphere we are able to distinguish the variations in distance of different buildings which appear placed on a single line as for instance when we see several buildings beyond a wall all of which as they appear above the top of the wall look of the same size while you wish to represent them in a picture as more remote one than another and to give the effect of a somewhat dense atmosphere you know that in an atmosphere of equal density the remotest objects seen through it as mountains in consequence of the great quantity of atmosphere between your eye and them appear blue and almost of the same hue as the atmosphere itself footnote quado il sole e per leuante when the sun is in the east apparently the author refers here to morning light in general h ludwig however translates this passage from the vatican copy wenn namlich die sonne dahinter im osten steht when the sun is in the east footnote see footnote hence you must make the nearest building above the wall of its real colour but the more distant ones make less defined and bluer those you wish should look farthest away you must make proportionately bluer thus if one is to be five times as distant make it five times bluer and by this rule the buildings which above a given line appear of the same size will plainly be distinguished as to which are the more remote and which larger than the others the medium lying between the eye and the object seen tinges that object with its colour as the blueness of the atmosphere makes the distant mountains appear blue and red glass makes objects seen beyond it look red the light shed round them by the stars is obscured by the darkness of the night which lies between the eye and the radiant light of the stars take care that the perspective of colour does not disagree with the size of your objects hat is to say that the colours diminish from their natural vividness in proportion as the objects at various distances dimmish from their natural size on the relative density of the atmosphere why the atmosphere must be represented as paler towards the lower portion because the atmosphere is dense near the earth and the higher it is the rarer it becomes when the sun is in the east if you look towards the west and a little way to the south and north you will see that this dense atmosphere receives more light from the sun than the rarer because the rays meet with greater resistance and if the sky as you see it ends on a low plain that lowest portion of the sky will be seen through a denser and whiter atmosphere which will weaken its true colour as seen through that medium and there the sky will look whiter than it is above you where the line of sight travels through a smaller space of air charged with heavy vapour and if you turn to the east the atmosphere will appear darker as you look lower down because the luminous rays pass less freely through the lower atmosphere of the mode of treating remote objects in painting it is easy to perceive that the atmosphere which lies closest to the level ground is denser than the rest and that where it is higher up it is rarer and more transparent the lower portions of large and lofty objects which are at a distance are not much seen because you see them along a line which passes through a denser and thicker section of the atmosphere the summits of such heights are seen along a line which though it starts from your eye in a dense atmosphere still as it ends at the top of those lofty objects ceases in a much rarer atmosphere than exists at their base for this reason the farther this line extends from your eye from point to point the atmosphere becomes more and more rare hence o painter when you represent mountains see that from hill to hill the bases are paler than the summits and in proportion as they recede beyond each other make the bases paler than the summits while the higher they are the more you must show of their true form and colour on the colour of the atmosphere of the colour of the atmosphere i say that the blueness we see in the atmosphere is not intrinsic colour but is caused by warm vapour evaporated in minute and insensible atoms on which the solar rays fall rendering them luminous against the infinite darkness of the fiery sphere which lies beyond and includes it and this may be seen as i saw it by any one going up footnote with regard to the place spoken of as m oboso compare no line its identity will be discussed under leonardo s topographical notes in vol ii monboso a peak of the alps which divide france from italy the base of this mountain gives birth to the four rivers which flow in four different directions through the whole of europe and no mountain has its base at so great a height as this which lifts itself almost above the clouds and snow seldom falls there but only hail in the summer when the clouds are highest and this hail lies unmelted there so that if it were not for the absorption of the rising and falling clouds which does not happen twice in an age an enormous mass of ice would be piled up there by the hail and in the middle of july i found it very considerable there i saw above me the dark sky and the sun as it fell on the mountain was far brighter here than in the plains below because a smaller extent of atmosphere lay between the summit of the mountain and the sun again as an illustration of the colour of the atmosphere i will mention the smoke of old and dry wood which as it comes out of a chimney appears to turn very blue when seen between the eye and the dark distance but as it rises and comes between the eye and the bright atmosphere it at once shows of an ashy grey colour and this happens because it no longer has darkness beyond it but this bright and luminous space if the smoke is from young green wood it will not appear blue because not being transparent and being full of superabundant moisture it has the effect of condensed clouds which take distinct lights and shadows like a solid body the same occurs with the atmosphere which when overcharged with moisture appears white and the small amount of heated moisture makes it dark of a dark blue colour and this will suffice us so far as concerns the colour of the atmosphere though it might be added that if this transparent blue were the natural colour of the atmosphere it would follow that wherever a larger mass air intervened between the eye and the element of fire the azure colour would be more intense as we see in blue glass and in sapphires which are darker in proportion as they are larger but the atmosphere in such circumstances behaves in an opposite manner inasmuch as where a greater quantity of it lies between the eye and the sphere of fire it is seen much whiter this occurs towards the horizon and the less the extent of atmosphere between the eye and the sphere of fire the deeper is the blue colour as may be seen even on low plains hence it follows as i say that the atmosphere assumes this azure hue by reason of the particles of moisture which catch the rays of the sun again we may note the difference in particles of dust or particles of smoke in the sun beams admitted through holes into a dark chamber when the former will look ash grey and the thin smoke will appear of a most beautiful blue and it may be seen again in in the dark shadows of distant mountains when the air between the eye and those shadows will look very blue though the brightest parts of those mountains will not differ much from their true colour but if any one wishes for a final proof let him paint a board with various colours among them an intense black and over all let him lay a very thin and transparent coating of white he will then see that this transparent white will nowhere show a more beautiful blue than over the black but it must be very thin and finely ground footnote reta here has the sense of malanno experience shows us that the air must have darkness beyond it and yet it appears blue if you produce a small quantity of smoke from dry wood and the rays of the sun fall on this smoke and if you then place behind the smoke a piece of black velvet on which the sun does not shine you will see that all the smoke which is between the eye and the black stuff will appear of a beautiful blue colour and if instead of the velvet you place a white cloth smoke that is too thick smoke hinders and too thin smoke does not produce the perfection of this blue colour hence a moderate amount of smoke produces the finest blue water violently ejected in a fine spray and in a dark chamber where the sun beams are admitted produces these blue rays and the more vividly if it is distilled water and thin smoke looks blue this i mention in order to show that the blueness of the atmosphere is caused by the darkness beyond it and these instances are given for those who cannot confirm my experience on monboso when the smoke from dry wood is seen between the eye of the spectator and some dark space or object it will look blue thus the sky looks blue by reason of the darkness beyond it and if you look towards the horizon of the sky you will see the atmosphere is not blue and this is caused by its density and thus at each degree as you raise your eyes above the horizon up to the sky over your head you will see the atmosphere look darker blue and this is because a smaller density of air lies between your eye and the outer darkness and if you go to the top of a high mountain the sky will look proportionately darker above you as the atmosphere becomes rarer between you and the outer darkness and this will be more visible at each degree of increasing height till at last we should find darkness that smoke will look bluest which rises from the driest wood and which is nearest to the fire and is seen against the darkest background and with the sunlight upon it a dark object will appear bluest in proportion as it has a greater mass of luminous atmosphere between it and the eye as may be seen in the colour of the sky the atmosphere is blue by reason of the darkness above it because black and white make blue in the morning the mist is denser above than below because the sun draws it upwards hence tall buildings even if the summit is at the same distance as the base have the summit invisible therefore also the sky looks darkest in colour overhead and towards the horizon it is not blue but rather between smoke and dust colour the atmosphere when full of mist is quite devoid of blueness and only appears of the colour of clouds which shine white when the weather is fine and the more you turn to the west the darker it will be and the brighter as you look to the east and the verdure of the fields is bluish in a thin mist but grows grey in a dense one the buildings in the west will only show their illuminated side where the sun shines and the mist hides the rest when the sun rises and chases away the haze the hills on the side where it lifts begin to grow clearer and look blue and seem to smoke with the vanishing mists and the buildings reveal their lights and shadows through the thinner vapour they show only their lights and through the thicker air nothing at all this is when the movement of the mist makes it part horizontally and then the edges of the mist will be indistinct against the blue of the sky and towards the earth it will look almost like dust blown up in proportion as the atmosphere is dense the buildings of a city and the trees in a landscape will look fewer because only the tallest and largest will be seen darkness affects every thing with its hue and the more an object differs from darkness the more we see its real and natural colour the mountains will look few because only those will be seen which are farthest apart since at such a distance the density increases to such a degree that it causes a brightness by which the darkness of the hills becomes divided and vanishes indeed towards the top there is less mist between lower and nearer hills and yet little is to be distinguished and least towards the bottom the surface of an object partakes of the colour of the light which illuminates it and of the colour of the atmosphere which lies between the eye and that object that is of the colour of the transparent medium lying between the object and the eye and among colours of a similar character the second will be of the same tone as the first and this is caused by the increased thickness of the colour of the medium lying between the object and the eye of painting of various colours which are none of them blue that which at a great distance will look bluest is the nearest to black and so conversely the colour which is least like black will at a great distance best preserve its own colour hence the green of fields will assume a bluer hue than yellow or white will and conversely yellow or white will change less than green and red still less vii on the proportions and on the movements of the human figure leonardo s researches on the proportions and movements of the human figure must have been for the most part completed and written before the year for luca paciolo writes in the dedication to ludovico il moro of his book divina proportione which was published in that year leonardo da venci hauedo gia co tutta diligetia al degno libro de pictura e movimenti humani posto fine the selection of leonardo s axioms contained in the vatican copy attributes these words to the author e il resto si dira nella universale misura del huomo manzi p ludwig no lomazzo again in his idea del tempio della pittura milano cap iv says lionardo vinci dimostro anco in figura tutte le proporzioni dei membri del corpo umano the vatican copy includes but very few sections of the universale misura del huomo and until now nothing has been made known of the original mss on the subject which have supplied the very extensive materials for this portion of the work the collection at windsor belonging to her majesty the queen includes by far the most important part of leonardo s investigations on this subject constituting about half of the whole of the materials here published and the large number of original drawings adds greatly to the interest which the subject itself must command luca paciolo would seem to have had these mss which i have distinguished by the initials w p in his mind when he wrote the passage quoted above still certain notes of a later date such as nos and from ms e written in sufficiently prove that leonardo did not consider his earlier studies on the proportions and movements of the human figure final and complete as we might suppose from luca paciolo s statement or else he took the subject up again at a subsequent period since his former researches had been carried on at milan between and indeed it is highly probable that the anatomical studies which he was pursuing zvith so much zeal between should have led him to reconsider the subject of proportion preliminary observations every man at three years old is half the full height he will grow to at last if a man braccia high is too small one of four is too tall the medium being what is admirable between and comes therefore take a man of braccia in height and measure him by the rule i will give you if you tell me that i may be mistaken and judge a man to be well proportioned who does not conform to this division i answer that you must look at many men of braccia and out of the larger number who are alike in their limbs choose one of those who are most graceful and take your measurements the length of the hand is of a braccio inches

calculations which m ravaisson has given appear to me in no way justified the sketch as we see it can hardly have been intended for any thing more than an experimental attempt to ascertain relative proportions we do not find that leonardo made use of circular lines in any other study of the proportions of the human head at the same time we see that the proportions of this sketch are not in accordance with the rules which he usually observed see for instance no the head a f larger than n f from the eyebrow to the junction of the lip with the chin and the angle of the jaw and the upper angle where the ear joins the temple will be a perfect square and each side by itself is half the head the hollow of the cheek bone occurs half way between the tip of the nose and the top of the jaw

the length from the tip of the nose to the eyebrows and in the same way in profile the distance from the extreme side of the nostril where it joins the cheek to the tip of the nose is equal to the width of the nose in front from one nostril to the other if you divide the whole length of the nose that is from the tip to the insertion of the eyebrows into equal parts you will find that one of

length of the foot without the toes if you hold your hand with the fingers straight out and close together you will find it to be of the same width as the widest part of the foot that is where it is joined onto the toes and if you measure from the prominence of the inner ancle to the end of the great toe you will find this measure to be as long as the whole hand from the top angle of the foot to

shoulder to the inner joint when extended when the arm is extended p n is equal to n a and when it is bent n a diminishes of its length and p n does the same the outer elbow joint increases when bent and thus by being bent it increases to the length of heads and on the inner side by bending it is found that whereas the arm from where it joins the side to the wrist was heads and a half in bending it loses the half head and measures only two one from the shoulder joint to the end by the elbow and the other to the hand the arm when folded will measure faces up to the shoulder from the elbow and

footnote see pl xx where the text is also seen from lines the movement of the arm in the innermost bend of the joints of every limb the reliefs are converted into a hollow and likewise every hollow of the innermost bends becomes a convexity when the limb is straightened to the utmost and in this very great mistakes are often made by those who have insufficient knowledge and trust to their own invention and do not have recourse to the imitation of nature and these variations occur more in the middle of the sides than in front and more at the back than at the sides when the arm is bent at an angle at the elbow it will produce some angle the more acute the angle is the more will the muscles within the bend be shortened while the muscles outside will become of greater length than before as is shown in the example d c e will shrink considerably and b n will be much extended footnote see pl xix no of painting the arm as it turns thrusts back its shoulder towards the middle of the back the principal movements of the hand are that is forwards backwards to right and to left in a circular motion up or down to close and to open and to spread the fingers or to press them together of the motions of the fingers the movements of the fingers principally consist in extending and bending them this extension and bending vary in manner that is sometimes they bend altogether at the first joint sometimes they bend or extend half way at the nd joint and sometimes they bend in their whole length and in all the three joints at once if the first joints are hindered from bending then the rd joint can be bent with greater ease than before it can never bend of itself if the other joints are free unless all three joints are bent besides all these movements there are other principal motions of which are up and down the two others from side to side and each of these is effected by a single tendon from these there follow an infinite number of other movements always effected by two tendons one tendon ceasing to act the other takes up the movement the tendons are made thick inside the fingers and thin outside and the tendons inside are attached to every joint but outside they are not

of manzi s edition also with no of ludwig s edition of the vatican copy just so much as the part d a of the nude figure decreases in this position so much does the opposite part increase that is in proportion as the length of the part d a diminishes the normal size so does the opposite upper part increase beyond its normal size the navel does not change its position to the male organ and this shrinking arises because when a figure stands on one foot that foot becomes the centre of gravity of the superimposed weight this being so the middle between the shoulders is thrust above it out of it

transverse lines are forced into such angles that their ends are lower on the side which is supported as is shown at a b c footnote see pl xxii no of painting note in the motions and attitudes of figures how the limbs vary and their feeling for the shoulderblades in the motions of the arms and shoulders vary the line of the back bone very much and you will find all the causes of this in my book of anatomy of change of attitude the pit of the throat is over the feet and by throwing one arm forward the pit of the throat is thrown off that foot and if the leg is thrown forward the pit of the throat is thrown forward and so it varies in every attitude of painting indicate which are the muscles and which the tendons which become prominent or retreat in the different movements of each limb or which do neither but are passive and remember that these indications of action are of the first importance and necessity in any painter or sculptor who professes to be a master c and indicate the same in a child and from birth to decrepitude at every stage of its life as infancy childhood boyhood youth c and in each express the alterations in the limbs and joints which swell and which grow thinner o anatomical painter beware lest the too strong indication of the bones sinews and muscles be the cause of your becoming wooden in your painting by your wish to make your nude figures display all their feeling therefore in endeavouring to remedy this look in what manner the muscles clothe or cover their bones in old or lean persons and besides this observe the rule as to how these same muscles fill up the spaces of the surface that extend between them which are the muscles which never lose their prominence in any amount of fatness and which too are the muscles of which the attachments are lost to sight in the very least plumpness and in many cases several muscles look like one single muscle in the increase of fat and in many cases in growing lean or old one single muscle divides into several muscles and in this treatise each in its place all their peculiarities will be explained and particularly as to the spaces between the joints of each limb c again do not fail to observe the variations in the forms of the above mentioned muscles round and about the joints of the limbs of any animal as caused by the diversity of the motions of each limb for on some side of those joints the prominence of these muscles is wholly lost in the increase or diminution of the flesh of which these muscles are composed c footnote de rossi remarks on this chapter in the roman edition of the trattato p non in questo luogo solo ma in altri ancora osserver il lettore che lionardo va fungendo quelli che fanno abuso della loro dottrina anatomica e sicuramente con ci ha in mira il suo rivale bonarroti che di anatomia facea tanta pompa note that leonardo wrote this passage in rome probably under the immediate impression of michaelangelo s paintings in the sistine chapel and of raphael s isaiah in sant agostino of the different measurements of boys and men there is a great difference in the length between the joints in men and boys for in man from the top of the shoulder by the neck to the elbow and from the elbow to the tip of the thumb and from one shoulder to the other is in each instance two heads while in a boy it is but one because nature constructs in us the mass which is the home of the intellect before forming that which contains the vital elements of painting which are the muscles which subdivide in old age or in youth when becoming lean which are the parts of the limbs of the human frame where no amount of fat makes the flesh thicker nor any degree of leanness ever diminishes it the thing sought for in this question will be found in all the external joints of the bones as the shoulder elbow wrists finger joints hips knees ankle bone and toes and the like all of which shall be told in its place the greatest thickness acquired by any limb is at the part of the muscles which is farthest from its attachments flesh never increases on those portions of the limb where the bones are near to the surface at b r d a c e f the increase or diminution of the flesh never makes any considerable difference nature has placed in front of man all those parts which feel most pain under a blow and these are the shin of the leg the forehead and the nose and this was done for the preservation of man since if such pain were not felt in these parts the number of blows to which they would be exposed must be the cause of their destruction describe why the bones of the arm and leg are double near the hand and foot respectively and where the flesh is thicker or thinner in the bending of the limbs of painting every part of the whole must be in proportion to the whole thus if a man is of a stout short figure he will be the same in all his parts that is with short and thick arms wide thick hands with short fingers with their joints of the same character and so on with the rest i would have the same thing understood as applying to all animals and plants in diminishing the various parts do so in due proportion to the size as also in enlarging of the agreement of the proportion of the limbs and again remember to be very careful in giving your figures limbs that they must appear to agree with the size of the body and likewise to the age thus a youth has limbs that are not very muscular not strongly veined and the surface is delicate and round and tender in colour in man the limbs are sinewy and muscular while in old men the surface is wrinkled rugged and knotty and the sinews very prominent how young boys have their joints just the reverse of those of men as to size little children have all the joints slender and the portions between them are thick and this happens because nothing but the skin covers the joints without any other flesh and has the character of sinew connecting the bones like a ligature and the fat fleshiness is laid on between one joint and the next and between the skin and the bones but since the bones are thicker at the joints than between them as a mass grows up the flesh ceases to have that superfluity which it had between the skin and the bones whence the skin clings more closely to the bone and the limbs grow more slender but since there is nothing over the joints but the cartilaginous and sinewy skin this cannot dry up and not drying up cannot shrink thus and for this reason children are slender at the joints and fat between the joints as may be seen in the joints of the fingers arms and shoulders which are slender and dimpled while in man on the contrary all the joints of the fingers arms and legs are thick and wherever children have hollows men have prominences the movement of the human figure of the manner of representing the actions of man repose movement running standing supported sitting leaning kneeling lying down suspended carrying or being carried thrusting pulling striking being struck pressing down and lifting up as to how a figure should stand with a weight in its hand footnote the original text ends here remember a sitting man cannot raise himself if that part of his body which is front of his axis centre of gravity does not weigh more than that which is behind that axis or centre without using his arms a man who is mounting any slope finds that he must involuntarily throw the most weight forward on the higher foot rather than behind that is in front of the axis and not behind it hence a man will always involuntarily throw the greater weight towards the point whither he desires to move than in any other direction the faster a man runs the more he leans forward towards the point he runs to and throws more weight in front of his axis than behind a man who runs down hill throws the axis onto his heels and one who runs up hill throws it into the points of his feet and a man running on level ground throws it first on his heels and then on the points of his feet this man cannot carry his own weight unless by drawing his body back he balances the weight in front in such a way as that the foot on which he stands is the centre of gravity footnote see pl xxii no how a man proceeds to raise himself to his feet when he is sitting on level ground a man when walking has his head in advance of his feet a man when walking across a long level plain first leans rather backwards and then as much forwards footnote he strides forward with the air of a man going down hill when weary on the contrary he walks like a man going up hill a man when running throws less weight on his legs than when standing still and in the same way a horse which is running feels less the weight of the man he carries hence many persons think it wonderful that in running the horse can rest on one single foot from this it may be stated that when a weight is in progressive motion the more rapid it is the less is the perpendicular weight towards the centre if a man in taking a jump from firm ground can leap braccia and when he was taking his leap it were to recede of a braccio that would be taken off his former leap and so if it were thrust forward of a braccio by how much would his leap be increased of drawing when a man who is running wants to neutralise the impetus that carries him on he prepares a contrary impetus which is generated by his hanging backwards this can be proved since if the impetus carries a moving body with a momentum equal to and the moving body wants to turn and fall back with a momentum of then one momentum neutralises the other contrary one and the impetus is neutralised of walking up and down when a man wants to stop running and check the impetus he is forced to hang back and take short quick steps footnote lines refer to the two upper figures and the lower figure to the right is explained by the last part of the chapter the centre of gravity of a man who lifts one of his feet from the ground always rests on the centre of the sole of the foot he stands on a man in going up stairs involuntarily throws so much weight forward and on the side of the upper foot as to be a counterpoise to the lower leg so that the labour of this lower leg is limited to moving itself the first thing a man does in mounting steps is to relieve the leg he is about to lift of the weight of the body which was resting on that leg and besides this he gives to the opposite leg all the rest of the bulk of the whole man including the weight of the other leg he then raises the other leg and sets the foot upon the step to which he wishes to raise himself having done this he restores to the upper foot all the weight of the body and of the leg itself and places his hand on his thigh and throws his head forward and repeats the movement towards the point of the upper foot quickly lifting the heel of the lower one and with this impetus he lifts himself up and at the same time extends the arm which rested on his knee and this extension of the arm carries up the body and the head and so straightens the spine which was curved the higher the step is which a man has to mount the farther forward will he place his head in advance of his upper foot so as to weigh more on a than on b this man will not be on the step m as is shown by the line g f footnote see pl xxiii no the lower sketch to the left belongs to the four first lines i ask the weight pressure of this man at every degree of motion on these steps what weight he gives to b and to c footnote these lines are in the original written in ink observe the perpendicular line below the centre of gravity of the man footnote see pl xxiii no in going up stairs if you place your hands on your knees all the labour taken by the arms is removed from the sinews at the back of the knees footnote see pl xxiii no the sinew which guides the leg and which is connected with the patella of the knee feels it a greater labour to carry the man upwards in proportion as the leg is more bent and the muscle which acts upon the angle made by the thigh where it joins the body has less difficulty and has a less weight to lift because it has not the additional weight of the thigh itself and besides this it has stronger muscles being those which form the buttock a man coming down hill takes little steps because the weight rests upon the hinder foot while a man mounting takes wide steps because his weight rests on the foremost foot footnote see pl xxiii no on the human body in action of the human body in action when you want to represent a man as moving some weight consider what the movements are that are to be represented by different lines that is to say either from below upwards with a simple movement as a man does who stoops forward to take up a weight which he will lift as he straightens himself or as a man does who wants to squash something backwards or to force it forwards or to pull it downwards with ropes passed through pullies footnote compare the sketch on page and on s k m ii b and here remember that the weight of a man pulls in proportion as his centre of gravity is distant from his fulcrum and to this is added the force given by his legs and bent back as he raises himself again a man has even a greater store of strength in his legs than he needs for his own weight and to see if this is true make a man stand on the shore sand and then put another man on his back and you will see how much he will sink in then take the man from off his back and make him jump straight up as high as he can and you will find that the print of his feet will be made deeper by the jump than from having the man on his back hence here by methods it is proved that a man has double the strength he requires to support his own body of painting if you have to draw a man who is in motion or lifting or pulling or carrying a weight equal to his own in what way must you set on his legs below his body footnote in the ms this question remains unanswered of the strength of man a man pulling a dead weight balanced against himself cannot pull more than his own weight and if he has to raise it he will be able to raise as much more than his weight as his strength may be more than that of other men footnote the stroke at the end of this line finishes in the original in a sort of loop or flourish and a similar flourish occurs at the end of the previous passage written on the same page m ravaisson regards these as numbers compare the photograph of page b in his edition of ms a he remarks ce chiffre et a la fin de l alinea precedent le chiffre sont dans le manuscrit des renvois the greatest force a man can apply with equal velocity and impetus will be when he sets his feet on one end of the balance or lever and then presses his shoulders against some stable body this will raise a weight at the other end of the balance lever equal to his own weight and added to that as much weight as he can carry on his shoulders no animal can simply move by its dead weight a greater weight than the sum of its own weight outside the centre of his fulcrum a man who wants to send an arrow very far from the bow must be standing entirely on one foot and raising the other so far from the foot he stands on as to afford the requisite counterpoise to his body which is thrown on the front foot and he must not hold his arm fully extended and in order that he may be more able to bear the strain he must hold a piece of wood which there is in all crossbows extending from the hand to the breast and when he wishes to shoot he suddenly leaps forward at the same instant and extends his arm with the bow and releases the string and if he dexterously does every thing at once it will go a very long way when two men are at the opposite ends of a plank that is balanced and if they are of equal weight and if one of them wants to make a leap into the air then his leap will be made down from his end of the plank and the man will never go up again but must remain in his place till the man at the other end dashes up the board footnote see pl xxiv no of delivering a blow to the right or left footnote four sketches on pl xxiv no belong to this passage the rest of the sketches and notes on that page are of a miscellaneous nature why an impetus is not spent at once but diminishes gradually in some one direction footnote the paper has been damaged at the end of line the impetus acquired in the line a b c d is spent in the line d e but not so completely but that some of its force remains in it and to this force is added the momentum in the line d e with the force of the motive power and it must follow than the impetus multiplied by the blow is greater that the simple impetus produced by the momentum d e footnote the sketch no on pl xxiv stands in the original between lines and compare also the sketches on pl liv a man who has to deal a great blow with his weapon prepares himself with all his force on the opposite side to that where the spot is which he is to hit and this is because a body as it gains in velocity gains in force against the object which impedes its motion on hair falling down in curls observe the motion of the surface of the water which resembles that of hair and has two motions of which one goes on with the flow of the surface the other forms the lines of the eddies thus the water forms eddying whirlpools one part of which are due to the impetus of the principal current and the other to the incidental motion and return flow footnote see pl xxv where also the text of this passage is given in facsimile on draperies of the nature of the folds in drapery that part of a fold which is farthest from the ends where it is confined will fall most nearly in its natural form every thing by nature tends to remain at rest drapery being of equal density and thickness on its wrong side and on its right has a tendency to lie flat therefore when you give it a fold or plait forcing it out of its flatness note well the result of the constraint in the part where it is most confined and the part which is farthest from this constraint you will see relapses most into the natural state that is to say lies free and flowing example footnote a c sia in the original text b is written instead of c an evident slip of the pen let a b c be the fold of the drapery spoken of above a c will be the places where this folded drapery is held fast i maintain that the part of the drapery which is farthest from the plaited ends will revert most to its natural form therefore b being farthest from a and c in the fold a b c it will be wider there than anywhere else footnote see pl xxviii no and compare the drawing from windsor pl xxx for farther illustration of what is here stated of small folds in draperies how figures dressed in a cloak should not show the shape so much as that the cloak looks as if it were next the flesh since you surely cannot wish the cloak to be next the flesh for you must suppose that between the flesh and the cloak there are other garments which prevent the forms of the limbs appearing distinctly through the cloak and those limbs which you allow to be seen you must make thicker so that the other garments may appear to be under the cloak but only give something of the true thickness of the limbs to a nymph footnote una nifa compare the beautiful drawing of a nymph in black chalk from the windsor collection pl xxvi or an angel which are represented in thin draperies pressed and clinging to the limbs of the figures by the action of the wind you ought not to give to drapery a great confusion of many folds but rather only introduce them where they are held by the hands or the arms the rest you may let fall simply where it is its nature to flow and do not let the nude forms be broken by too many details and interrupted folds how draperies should be drawn from nature that is to say if youwant to represent woollen cloth draw the folds from that and if it is to be silk or fine cloth or coarse or of linen or of crape vary the folds in each and do not represent dresses as many do from models covered with paper or thin leather which will deceive you greatly footnote the little pen and ink drawing from windsor w given on pl xxviii no clearly illustrates the statement made at the beginning of this passage the writing of the cipher on the same page is in leonardo s hand the cipher is certainly not viii botany for painters and elements of landscape painting the chapters composing this portion of the work consist of observations on form light and shade in plants and particularly in trees summed up in certain general rules by which the author intends to guide the artist in the pictorial representation of landscape with these the first principles of a theory of landscape painting are laid down a theory as profoundly thought out in its main lines as it is lucidly worked out in its details in reading these chapters the conviction is irresistible that such a botany for painters is or ought to be of similar importance in the practice of painting as the principles of the proportions and movements of the human figure i e anatomy for painters there can be no doubt that leonardo in laying down these rules did not intend to write on botany in the proper scientific sense his own researches on that subject have no place here it need only be observed that they are easily distinguished by their character and contents from those which are here collected and arranged under the title botany for painters in some cases where this division might appear doubtful as for instance in no the painter is directly addressed and enjoined to take the rule to heart as of special importance in his art the original materials are principally derived from ms g in which we often find this subject treated on several pages in succession without any of that intermixture of other matters which is so frequent in leonardo s writings this ms too is one of the latest when it was written the great painter was already more than sixty years of age so we can scarcely doubt that he regarded all he wrote as his final views on the subject and the same remark applies to the chapters from mss e and m which were also written between for the sake of clearness however it has been desirable to sacrifice with few exceptions the original order of the passages as written though it was with much reluctance and only after long hesitation that i resigned myself to this necessity nor do i mean to impugn the logical connection of the author s ideas in his ms but it will be easily understood that the sequence of disconnected notes as they occurred to leonardo and were written down from time to time might be hardly satisfactory as a systematic arrangement of his principles the reader will find in the appendix an exact account of the order of the chapters in the original ms and from the data there given can restore them at will as the materials are here arranged the structure of the tree as regards the growth of the branches comes first and then the insertion of the leaves on the stems then follow the laws of light and shade as applied first to the leaves and secondly to the whole tree and to groups of trees after the remarks on the light and shade in landscapes generally we find special observations on that of views of towns and buildings to the theory of landscape painting belong also the passages on the effect of wind on trees and on the light and shade of clouds since we find in these certain comparisons with the effect of light and shade on trees e g in no and no the chapters given in the appendix nos and have hardly any connection with the subjects previously treated classification of trees trees small lofty straggling thick that is as to foliage dark light russet branched at the top some directed towards the eye some downwards with white stems this transparent in the air that not some standing close together some scattered the relative thickness of the branches to the trunk all the branches of a tree at every stage of its height when put together are equal in thickness to the trunk below them all the branches of a water course at every stage of its course if they are of equal rapidity are equal to the body of the main stream every year when the boughs of a plant or tree have made an end of maturing their growth they will have made when put together a thickness equal to that of the main stem and at every stage of its ramification you will find the thickness of the said main stem as i k g h e f c d a b will always be equal to each other unless the tree is pollard if so the rule does not hold good all the branches have a direction which tends to the centre of the tree m footnote the two sketches of leafless trees one above another on the left hand side of pl xxvii no belong to this passage if the plant n grows to the thickness shown at m its branches will correspond in thickness to the junction a b in consequence of the growth inside as well as outside the branches of trees or plants have a twist wherever a minor branch is given off and this giving off the branch forms a fork this said fork occurs between two angles of which the largest will be that which is on the side of the larger branch and in proportion unless accident has spoilt it footnote the sketches illustrating this are on the right hand side of pi xxvii no i and the text is also given there in facsimile there is no boss on branches which has not been produced by some branch which has failed the lower shoots on the branches of trees grow more than the upper ones and this occurs only because the sap that nourishes them being heavy tends downwards more than upwards and again because those branches which grow downwards turn away from the shade which exists towards the centre of the plant the older the branches are the greater is the difference between their upper and their lower shoots and in those dating from the same year or epoch footnote the sketch accompanying this in the ms is so effaced that an exact reproduction was impossible of the scars on trees the scars on trees grow to a greater thickness than is required by the sap of the limb which nourishes them the plant which gives out the smallest ramifications will preserve the straightest line in the course of its growth footnote this passage is illustrated by two partly effaced sketches one of these closely resembles the lower one given under no the other also represents short closely set boughs on an upright trunk of the ramification the beginning of the ramification the shoot always has the central line axis of its thickness directed to the central line axis of the plant itself in starting from the main stem the branches always form a base with a prominence as is shown at a b c d why very frequently timber has veins that are not straight when the branches which grow the second year above the branch of the preceding year are not of equal thickness above the antecedent branches but are on one side then the vigour of the lower branch is diverted to nourish the one above it although it may be somewhat on one side but if the ramifications are equal in their growth the veins of the main stem will be straight parallel and equidistant at every degree of the height of the plant wherefore o painter you who do not know these laws in order to escape the blame of those who understand them it will be well that you should represent every thing from nature and not despise such study as those do who work only for money the direction of growth of the ramifications of plants the plants which spread very much have the angles of the spaces which divide their branches more obtuse in proportion as their point of origin is lower down that is nearer to the thickest and oldest portion of the tree therefore in the youngest portions of the tree the angles of ramification are more acute footnote compare the sketches on the lower portion of pl xxvii no the tips of the boughs of plants and trees unless they are borne down by the weight of their fruits turn towards the sky as much as possible the upper side of their leaves is turned towards the sky that it may receive the nourishment of the dew which falls at night the sun gives spirit and life to plants and the earth nourishes them with moisture with regard to this i made the experiment of leaving only one small root on a gourd and this i kept nourished with water and the gourd brought to perfection all the fruits it could produce which were about gourds of the long kind andi set my mind diligently to consider this vitality and perceived that the dews of night were what supplied it abundantly with moisture through the insertion of its large leaves and gave nourishment to the plant and its offspring or the seeds which its offspring had to produce the rule of the leaves produced on the last shoot of the year will be that they will grow in a contrary direction on the twin branches that is that the insertion of the leaves turns round each branch in such a way as that the sixth leaf above is produced over the sixth leaf below and the way they turn is that if one turns towards its companion to the right the other turns to the left the leaf serving as the nourishing breast for the shoot or fruit which grows the following year footnote a french translation of lines was given by m ravaisson in the gazette des beaux arts oct his paper also contains some valuable information as to botanical science in the ancient classical writers and at the time of the renaissance the lowest branches of those trees which have large leaves and heavy fruits such as nut trees fig trees and the like always droop towards the ground the branches always originate above in the axis of the leaves the upper shoots of the lateral branches of plants lie closer to the parent branch than the lower ones the lowest branches after they have formed the angle of their separation from the parent stem always bend downwards so as not to crowd against the other branches which follow them on the same stem and to be better able to take the air which nourishes them as is shown by the angle b a c the branch a c after it has made the corner of the angle a c bends downwards to c d and the lesser shoot c dries up being too thin the main branch always goes below as is shown by the branch f n m which does not go to f n o the forms of trees the elm always gives a greater length to the last branches of the year s growth than to the lower ones and nature does this because the highest branches are those which have to add to the size of the tree and those at the bottom must get dry because they grow in the shade and their growth would be an impediment to the entrance of the solar rays and the air among the main branches of the tree the main branches of the lower part bend down more than those above so as to be more oblique than those upper ones and also because they are larger and older in general almost all the upright portions of trees curve somewhat turning the convexity towards the south and their branches are longer and thicker and more abundant towards the south than towards the north and this occurs because the sun draws the sap towards that surface of the tree which is nearest to it and this may be observed if the sun is not screened off by other plants the cherry tree is of the character of the fir tree as regards its ramification placed in stages round its main stem and its branches spring or five or together opposite each other and the tips of the topmost shoots form a pyramid from the middle upwards and the walnut and oak form a hemisphere from the middle upwards the bough of the walnut which is only hit and beaten when it has brought to perfection footnote the end of the text and the sketch in red chalk belonging to it are entirely effaced the insertion of the leaves of the insertion of the branches on plants such as the growth of the ramification of plants is on their principal branches so is that of the leaves on the shoots of the same plant these leaves have footnote quattro modi four modes only three are described in the text the fourth is only suggested by a sketch this passage occurs in manzi s edition of the trattato p but without the sketches

the top of the boughs than at the base and the broad surface of the leaves varies little as to angle and aspect footnote see pl xxvii no above the sketch and close under the number of the page is the word olmo elm in the walnut tree the leaves which are distributed on the shoots of this year are further apart from each other and more numerous in proportion as the branch from which this shoot springs is a young one and they are inserted more closely and less in number when the shoot that bears them springs from an old branch its fruits are borne at the ends of the shoots and its largest boughs are the lowest on the boughs they spring from and this arises from the weight of its sap which is more apt to descend than to rise and consequently the branches which spring from them and rise towards the sky are small and slender and when the shoot turns towards the sky its leaves spread out from it at an angle with an equal distribution of their tips and if the shoot turns to the horizon the leaves lie flat and this arises from the fact that leaves without exception turn their underside to the earth the shoots are smaller in proportion as they spring nearer to the base of the bough they spring from footnote see the two sketches on pl xxvii no the second refers to the passage lines of the insertion of the leaves on the branches the thickness of a branch never diminishes within the space between one leaf and the next excepting by so much as the thickness of the bud which is above the leaf and this thickness is taken off from the branch above the node as far as the next leaf nature has so placed the leaves of the latest shoots of many plants that the sixth leaf is always above the first and so on in succession if the rule is not accidentally interfered with and this occurs for two useful ends in the plant first that as the shoot and the fruit of the following year spring from the bud or eye which lies above and in close contact with the insertion of the leaf in the axil the water which falls upon the shoot can run down to nourish the bud by the drop being caught in the hollow axil at the insertion of the leaf and the second advantage is that as these shoots develop in the following year one will not cover the next below since the come forth on five different sides and the sixth which is above the first is at some distance of the ramifications of trees and their foliage the ramifications of any tree such as the elm are wide and slender after the manner of a hand with spread fingers foreshortened and these are seen in the distribution thus the lower portions are seen from above and those that are above are seen from below and those in the middle some from below and some from above the upper part is the extreme top of this ramification and the middle portion is more foreshortened than any other of those which are turned with their tips towards you and of those parts of the middle of the height of the tree the longest will be towards the top of the tree and will produce a ramification like the foliage of the common willow which grows on the banks of rivers other ramifications are spherical as those of such trees as put forth their shoots and leaves in the order of the sixth being placed above the first others are thin and light like the willow and others you will see in the lower branches of the elder which puts forth leaves two and two placed crosswise at right angles one above another that if the stem rises straight up towards the sky this order never fails and its largest leaves are on the thickest part of the stem and the smallest on the slenderest part that is towards the top but to return to the lower branches i say that the leaves on these are placed on them crosswise like those on the upper branches and as by the law of all leaves they are compelled to turn their upper surface towards the sky to catch the dew at night it is necessary that those so placed should twist round and no longer form a cross footnote see pl xxvii no a leaf always turns its upper side towards the sky so that it may the better receive on all its surface the dew which drops gently from the atmosphere and these leaves are so distributed on the plant as that one shall cover the other as little as possible but shall lie alternately one above another as may be seen in the ivy which covers the walls and this alternation serves two ends that is to leave intervals by which the air and sun may penetrate between them the nd reason is that the drops which fall from the first leaf may fall onto the fourth or in other trees onto the sixth every shoot and every fruit is produced above the insertion in the axil of its leaf which serves it as a mother giving it water from the rain and moisture from the dew which falls at night from above and often it protects them against the too great heat of the rays of the sun light on branches and leaves that part of the body will be most illuminated which is hit by the luminous ray coming between right angles footnote see pl xxviii no young plants have more transparent leaves and a more lustrous bark than old ones and particularly the walnut is lighter coloured in may than in september of the accidents of colouring in trees the accidents of colour in the foliage of trees are that is shadow light lustre reflected light and transparency of the visibility of these accidents these accidents of colour in the foliage of trees become confused at a great distance and that which has most breadth whether light or shade c will be most conspicuous the proportions of light and shade in a leaf of the shadows of a leaf sometimes a leaf has three accidents of light that is shade lustre reflected light and transparency transmitted light thus if the light were at n as regards the leaf s and the eye at m it would see a in full light b in shadow and c transparent a leaf with a concave surface seen from the under side and up side down will sometimes show itself as half in shade and half transparent thus if o p is the leaf and the light m and the eye n this will see o in shadow because the light does not fall upon it between equal angles neither on the upper nor the under side and p is lighted on the upper side and the light is transmitted to its under side footnote see pl xxviii no the upper sketch on the page in the original they are drawn in red chalk although those leaves which have a polished surface are to a great extent of the same colour on the right side and on the reverse it may happen that the side which is turned towards the atmosphere will have something of the colour of the atmosphere and it will seem to have more of this colour of the atmosphere in proportion as the eye is nearer to it and sees it more foreshortened and without exception the shadows show as darker on the upper side than on the lower from the contrast offered by the high lights which limit the shadows the under side of the leaf although its colour may be in itself the same as that of the upper side shows a still finer colour a colour that is green verging on yellow and this happens when the leaf is placed between the eye and the light which falls upon it from the opposite side and its shadows are in the same positions as those were of the opposite side therefore o painter when you do trees close at hand remember that if the eye is almost under the tree you will see its leaves some on the upper and some on the under side and the upper side will be bluer in proportion as they are seen more foreshortened and the same leaf sometimes shows part of the right side and part of the under side whence you must make it of two colours of the transparency of leaves the shadows in transparent leaves seen from the under side are the same shadows as there are on the right side of this leaf they will show through to the underside together with lights but the lustre reflected light can never show through when one green has another green behind it the lustre on the leaves and their transparent lights show more strongly than in those which are seen against the brightness of the atmosphere and if the sun illuminates the leaves without their coming between it and the eye and without the eye facing the sun then the reflected lights and the transparent lights are very strong it is very effective to show some branches which are low down and dark and so set off the illuminated greens which are at some distance from the dark greens seen below that part is darkest which is nearest to the eye or which is farthest from the luminous atmosphere never paint leaves transparent to the sun because they are confused and this is because on the transparency of one leaf will be seen the shadow of another leaf which is above it this shadow has a distinct outline and a certain depth of shade and sometimes is as much as half or a third of the leaf which is shaded and consequently such an arrangement is very confused and the imitation of it should be avoided the light shines least through a leaf when it falls upon it at an acute angle the gradations of shade and colour in leaves the shadows of plants are never black for where the atmosphere penetrates there can never be utter darkness if the light comes from m and the eye is at n the eye will see the colour of the leaves a b all affected by the colour of m that is of the atmosphere and b c will be seen from the under side as transparent with a beautiful green colour verging on yellow if m is the luminous body lighting up the leaf s all the eyes that see the under side of this leaf will see it of a beautiful light green being transparent in very many cases the positions of the leaves will be without shadow or in full light and their under side will be transparent and the right side lustrous reflecting light the willow and other similar trees which have their boughs lopped every or years put forth very straight branches and their shadow is about the middle where these boughs spring and towards the extreme ends they cast but little shade from having small leaves and few and slender branches hence the boughs which rise towards the sky will have but little shade and little relief and the branches which are at an angle from the horizon downwards spring from the dark part of the shadow and grow thinner by degrees up to their ends and these will be in strong relief being in gradations of light against a background of shadow that tree will have the least shadow which has the fewest branches and few leaves of dark leaves in front of transparent ones when the leaves are interposed between the light and the eye then that which is nearest to the eye will be the darkest and the most distant will be the lightest not being seen against the atmosphere and this is seen in the leaves which are away from the centre of the tree that is towards the light footnote see pl xxviii no the lower sketch of the lights on dark leaves the lights on such leaves which are darkest will be most near to the colour of the atmosphere that is reflected in them and the cause of this is that the light on the illuminated portion mingles with the dark hue to compose a blue colour and this light is produced by the blueness of the atmosphere which is reflected in the smooth surface of these leaves and adds to the blue hue which this light usually produces when it falls on dark objects of the lights on leaves of a yellowish green but leaves of a green verging on yellow when they reflect the atmosphere do not produce a reflection verging on blue inasmuch as every thing which appears in a mirror takes some colour from that mirror hence the blue of the atmosphere being reflected in the yellow of the leaf appears green because blue and yellow mixed together make a very fine green colour therefore the lustre of light leaves verging on yellow will be greenish yellow a classification of trees according to their colours the trees in a landscape are of various kinds of green inasmuch as some verge towards blackness as firs pines cypresses laurels box and the like some tend to yellow such as walnuts and pears vines and verdure some are both yellowish and dark as chesnuts holm oak some turn red in autumn as the service tree pomegranate vine and cherry and some are whitish as the willow olive reeds and the like trees are of various forms the proportions of light and shade in trees of a generally distributed light as lighting up trees that part of the trees will be seen to lie in the least dark shadow which is farthest from the earth to prove it let a p be the tree n b c the illuminated hemisphere the sky the under portion of the tree faces the earth p c that is on the side o and it faces a small part of the hemisphere at c d but the highest part of the convexity a faces the greatest part of the hemisphere that is b c for this reason and because it does not face the darkness of the earth it is in fuller light but if the tree has dense foliage as the laurel arbutus box or holm oak it will be different because although a does not face the earth it faces the dark green of the leaves cut up by many shadows and this darkness is reflected onto the under sides of the leaves immediately above thus these trees have their darkest shadows nearest to the middle of the tree of the shadows of verdure the shadows of verdure are always somewhat blue and so is every shadow of every object and they assume this hue more in proportion as they are remote from the eye and less in proportion as they are nearer the leaves which reflect the blue of the atmosphere always present themselves to the eye edgewise of the illuminated part of verdure and of mountains the illuminated portion at a great distance will appear most nearly of its natural colour where the strongest light falls upon it of trees that are lighted by the sun and by the atmosphere in trees that are illuminated both by the sun and the atmosphere and that have leaves of a dark colour one side will be illuminated by the atmosphere only and in consequence of this light will tend to blueness while on the other side they will be illuminated by the atmosphere and the sun and the side which the eye sees illuminated by the sun will reflect light of depicting a forest scene the trees and plants which are most thickly branched with slender branches ought to have less dark shadow than those trees and plants which having broader leaves will cast more shadow on painting in the position of the eye which sees that portion of a tree illuminated which turns towards the light one tree will never be seen to be illuminated equally with the other to prove this let the eye be c which sees the two trees b d which are illuminated by the sun a i say that this eye c will not see the light in the same proportion to the shade in one tree as in the other because the tree which is nearest to the sun will display so much the stronger shadow than the more distant one in proportion as one tree is nearer to the rays of the sun that converge to the eye than the other c you see that the eye c sees nothing of the tree d but shadow while the same eye c sees th tree b half in light and half in shade when a tree is seen from below the eye sees the top of it as placed within the circle made by its boughs remember o painter that the variety of depth of shade in any one particular species of tree is in proportion to the rarity or density of their branches footnote the two lower sketches on the left of pl xxviii no refer to lines the upper sketch has apparently been effaced by leonardo himself the distribution of light and shade with reference to the position of the spectator the shadows of trees placed in a landscape do not display themselves in the same position in the trees on the right hand and those on the left still more so if the sun is to the right or left as is proved by the th which says opaque bodies placed between the light and the eye display themselves entirely in shadow and by the th the eye when placed between the opaque body and the light sees the opaque body entirely illuminated and by the th when the eye and the opaque body are placed between darkness and light it will be seen half in shadow and half in light footnote see the figure on the right hand side of pl xxviii no the first five lines of the text are written below the diagram and above it are the last eight lines of the text given as no of the herbs of the field of the plants which take a shadow from the plants which spring among them those which are on this side in front of the shadow have the stems lighted up on a background of shadow and the plants on which the shadows fall have their stems dark on a light background that is on the background beyond the shadow of trees which are between the eye and the light of the trees which are between the eye and the light the part in front will be light but this light will be broken by the ramifications of transparent leaves being seen from the under side and lustrous leaves being seen from the upper side and the background below and behind will be dark green being in shadow from the front portion of the said tree this occurs in trees placed above the eye from whence to depict a landscape landscapes should be represented so that the trees may be half in light and half in shadow but it is better to do them when the sun is covered with clouds for then the trees are lighted by the general light of the sky and the general darkness of the earth and then they are darkest in certain parts in proportion as those parts are nearest to the middle of the tree and to the earth the effects of morning light of trees to the south when the sun is in the east the trees to the south and to the north have almost as much light as shadow but a greater share of light in proportion as they lie to the west and a greater share of shadow in proportion as they lie to the east of meadows if the sun is in the east the verdure of the meadows and of other small plants is of a most beautiful green from being transparent to the sun this does not occur in the meadows to the west and in those to the south and north the grass is of a moderately brilliant green of the points of the compass in landscapes when the sun is in the east all the portions of plants lighted by it are of a most lively verdure and this happens because the leaves lighted by the sun within the half of the horizon that is the eastern half are transparent and within the western semicircle the verdure is of a dull hue and the moist air is turbid and of the colour of grey ashes not being transparent like that in the east which is quite clear and all the more so in proportion as it is moister the shadows of the trees to the east cover a large portion of them and are darker in proportion as the foliage of the trees is thicker of trees in the east when the sun is in the east the trees seen towards the east will have the light which surrounds them all round their shadows excepting on the side towards the earth unless the tree has been pruned below in the past year and the trees to the south and north will be half in shade and half in light and more or less in shade or in light in proportion as they are more or less to the east or to the west the position of the eye above or below varies the shadows and lights in trees inasmuch as the eye placed above sees the tree with the little shadow and the eye placed below with a great deal of shadow the colour of the green in plants varies as much as their species of the shadows in trees the sun being in the east to the right the trees to the west or left of the eye will show in small relief and almost imperceptible gradations because the atmosphere which lies between the eye and those trees is very dense footnote per la a di questo this possibly referred to something written on the seventh page of this note book marked g unfortunately it has been cut out and lost see the th of this and they have no shade for though a shadow exists in every detail of the ramification it results that the images of the shade and light that reach the eye are confused and mingled together and cannot be perceived on account of their minuteness and the principal lights are in the middle of the trees and the shadows to wards the edges and their separation is shown by the shadows of the intervals between the trees but when the forests are thick with trees the thin edges are but little seen of trees to the east when the sun is in the east the trees are darker towards the middle while their edges are light the effects of midday light objects in high light show but little but between light and shadow they stand out well to represent a landscape choose that the sun shall be at noon and look towards the west or east and then draw and if you turn towards the north every object placed on that side will have no shadow particularly those which are nearest to the direction of the shadow of your head and if you turn towards the south every object on that side will be wholly in shadow all the trees which are towards the sun and have the atmosphere for their background are dark and the other trees which lie against that darkness will be black very dark in the middle and lighter towards the edges the appearance of trees in the distance of the spaces showing the sky in trees themselves the spaces between the parts in the mass of trees and the spaces between the trees in the air are at great distances invisible to the eye for where it is an effort even to see the whole it is most difficult to discern the parts but a confused mixture is the result partaking chiefly of the hue which predominates the spaces between the leaves consist of particles of illuminated air which are very much smaller than the tree and are lost sight of sooner than the tree but it does not therefore follow that they are not there hence necessarily a compounded effect is produced of the sky and of the shadows of the tree in shade which both together strike the eye which sees them of trees which conceal these spaces in one another that part of a tree will show the fewest spaces behind which a large number of trees are standing between the tree and the air sky thus in the tree a the spaces are not concealed nor in b as there is no tree behind but in c only half shows the spaces filled up by the tree d and part of the tree d is filled up by the tree e and a little farther on all the spaces in the mass of the trees are lost and only that at the side remains of trees what outlines are seen in trees at a distance against the sky which serves as their background the outlines of the ramification of trees where they lie against the illuminated sky display a form which more nearly approaches the spherical on proportion as they are remote and the nearer they are the less they appear in this spherical form as in the first tree a which being near to the eye displays the true form of its ramification but this shows less in b and is altogether lost in c where not merely the branches of the tree cannot be seen but the whole tree is distinguished with difficulty every object in shadow of whatever form it may be at a great distance appears to be spherical and this occurs because if it is a square body at a very short distance it loses its angles and a little farther off it loses still more of its smaller sides which remain and thus before the whole is lost to sight the parts are lost being smaller than the whole as a man who in such a distant position loses his legs arms and head before the mass of his body then the outlines of length are lost before those of breadth and where they have become equal it would be a square if the angles remained but as they are lost it is round footnote the sketch no pl xxviii belongs to this passage the cast shadow of trees the image of the shadow of any object of uniform breadth can never be exactly the same as that of the body which casts it footnote see pl xxviii no light and shade on groups of trees all trees seen against the sun are dark towards the middle and this shadow will be of the shape of the tree when apart from others the shadows cast by trees on which the sun shines are as dark as those of the middle of the tree the shadow cast by a tree is never less than the mass of the tree but becomes taller in proportion as the spot on which it falls slopes towards the centre of the world the shadow will be densest in the middle of the tree when the tree has the fewest branches footnote the three diagrams which accompany this text are placed in the original before lines at the spots marked b leonardo wrote albero tree at a is the word sole sun at c monte mountain at d piano plain and at e cima summit every branch participates of the central shadow of every other branch and consequently of that of the whole tree the form of any shadow from a branch or tree is circumscribed by the light which falls from the side whence the light comes and this illumination gives the shape of the shadow and this may be of the distance of a mile from the side where the sun is if it happens that a cloud should anywhere overshadow some part of a hill the shadow of the trees there will change less than in the plains for these trees on the hills have their branches thicker because they grow less high each year than in the plains therefore as these branches are dark by nature and being so full of shade the shadow of the clouds cannot darken them any more but the open spaces between the trees which have no strong shadow change very much in tone and particularly those which vary from green that is ploughed lands or fallen mountains or barren lands or rocks where the trees are against the atmosphere they appear all the same colour if indeed they are not very close together or very thickly covered with leaves like the fir and similar trees when you see the trees from the side from which the sun lights them you will see them almost all of the same tone and the shadows in them will be hidden by the leaves in the light which come between your eye and those shadows trees at a short distance footnote the heading alberi vicini trees at a short distance is in the original manuscript written in the margin when the trees are situated between the sun and the eye beyond the shadow which spreads from their centre the green of their leaves will be seen transparent but this transparency will be broken in many places by the leaves and boughs in shadow which will come between you and them or in their upper portions they will be accompanied by many lights reflected from the leaves the trees of the landscape stand out but little from each other because their illuminated portions come against the illuminated portions of those beyond and differ little from them in light and shade of trees seen from below and against the light one beyond the other and near together the topmost part of the first will be in great part transparent and light and will stand out against the dark portion of the second tree and thus it will be with all in succession that are placed under the same conditions let s be the light and r the eye c d n the first tree a b c the second then i say that r the eye will see the portion c f in great part transparent and lighted by the light s which falls upon it from the opposite side and it will see it on a dark ground b c because that is the dark part and shadow of the tree a b c but if the eye is placed at t it will see o p dark on the light background n g of the transparent and shadowy parts of trees that which is nearest to you is the darkest that part of a tree which has shadow for background is all of one tone and wherever the trees or branches are thickest they will be darkest because there are no little intervals of air but where the boughs lie against a background of other boughs the brighter parts are seen lightest and the leaves lustrous from the sunlight falling on them in the composition of leafy trees be careful not to repeat too often the same colour of one tree against the same colour of another behind it but vary it with a lighter or a darker or a stronger green on the treatment of light for landscapes the landscape has a finer azure tone when in fine weather the sun is at noon than at any other time of the day because the air is purified of moisture and looking at it under that aspect you will see the trees of a beautiful green at the outside and the shadows dark towards the middle and in the remoter distance the atmosphere which comes between you and them looks more beautiful when there is something dark beyond and still the azure is most beautiful the objects seen from the side on which the sun shines will not show you their shadows but if you are lower than the sun you can see what is not seen by the sun and that will be all in shade the leaves of the trees which come between you and the sun are of two principal colours which are a splendid lustre of green and the reflection of the atmosphere which lights up the objects which cannot be seen by the sun and the shaded portions which only face the earth and the darkest which are surrounded by something that is not dark the trees in the landscape which are between you and the sun are far more beautiful than those you see when you are between the sun and them and this is so because those which face the sun show their leaves as transparent towards the ends of their branches and those that are not transparent that is at the ends reflect the light and the shadows are dark because they are not concealed by any thing the trees when you place yourself between them and the sun will only display to you their light and natural colour which in itself is not very strong and besides this some reflected lights which being against a background which does not differ very much from themselves in tone are not conspicuous and if you are lower down than they are situated they may also show those portions on which the light of the sun does not fall and these will be dark in the wind but if you are on the side whence the wind blows you will see the trees look very much lighter than on the other sides and this happens because the wind turns up the under side of the leaves which in all trees is much whiter than the upper sides and more especially will they be very light indeed if the wind blows from the quarter where the sun is and if you have your back turned to it footnote at s in the original is the word sole sun and at n parte di nuvolo the side of the clouds when the sun is covered by clouds objects are less conspicuous because there is little difference between the light and shade of the trees and of the buildings being illuminated by the brightness of the atmosphere which surrounds the objects in such a way that the shadows are few and these few fade away so that their outline is lost in haze of trees and lights on them the best method of practice in representing country scenes or i should say landscapes with their trees is to choose them so that the sun is covered with clouds so that the landscape receives an universal light and not the direct light of the sun which makes the shadows sharp and too strongly different from the lights of painting in landscapes which represent a scene in winter the mountains should not be shown blue as we see in the mountains in the summer and this is proved footnote per la a di questo it is impossible to ascertain what this quotation refers to questo certainly does not mean the ms in hand nor any other now known to us the same remark applies to the phrase in line per la a di questo in the th of this which says among mountains seen from a great distance those will look of the bluest colour which are in themselves the darkest hence when the trees are stripped of their leaves they will show a bluer tinge which will be in itself darker therefore when the trees have lost their leaves they will look of a gray colour while with their leaves they are green and in proportion as the green is darker than the grey hue the green will be of a bluer tinge than the gray also by the nd of this the shadows of trees covered with leaves are darker than the shadows of those trees which have lost their leaves in proportion as the trees covered with leaves are denser than those without leaves and thus my meaning is proved the definition of the blue colour of the atmosphere explains why the landscape is bluer in the summer than in the winter of painting in a landscape if the slope of a hill comes between the eye and the horizon sloping towards the eye while the eye is opposite the middle of the height of this slope then that hill will increase in darkness throughout its length this is proved by the th of this which says that a tree looks darkest when it is seen from below the proposition is verified since this hill will on its upper half show all its trees as much from the side which is lighted by the light of the sky as from that which is in shade from the darkness of the earth whence it must result that these trees are of a medium darkness and from this middle spot towards the base of the hill these trees will be lighter by degrees by the converse of the th and by the said th for trees so placed the nearer they are to the summit of the hill the darker they necessarily become but this darkness is not in proportion to the distance by the th of this which says that object shows darkest which is seen in the clearest atmosphere and by the th that shows darkest which stands out against a lighter background footnote the quotation in this passage again cannot be verified of landscapes the colours of the shadows in mountains at a great distance take a most lovely blue much purer than their illuminated portions and from this it follows that when the rock of a mountain is reddish the illuminated portions are violet and the more they are lighted the more they display their proper colour a place is most luminous when it is most remote from mountains on the treatment of light for views of towns of light and shadow in a town when the sun is in the east and the eye is above the centre of a town the eye will see the southern part of the town with its roofs half in shade and half in light and the same towards the north the eastern side will be all in shadow and the western will be all in light of the houses of a town in which the divisions between the houses may be distinguished by the light which fall on the mist at the bottom if the eye is above the houses the light seen in the space that is between one house and the next sinks by degrees into thicker mist and yet being less transparent it appears whiter and if the houses are some higher than the others since the true colour is always more discernible through the thinner atmosphere the houses will look darker in proportion as they are higher up let n o p q represent the various density of the atmosphere thick with moisture a being the eye the house b c will look lightest at the bottom because it is in a thicker atmosphere the lines c d f will appear equally light for although f is more distant than c it is raised into a thinner atmosphere if the houses b e are of the same height because they cross a brightness which is varied by mist but this is only because the line of the eye which starts from above ends by piercing a lower and denser atmosphere at d than at b thus the line a f is lower at f than at c and the house f will be seen darker at e from the line e k as far as m than the tops of the houses standing in front of it of towns or other buildings seen in the evening or the morning through the mist of buildings seen at a great distance in the evening or the morning as in mist or dense atmosphere only those portions are seen in brightness which are lighted up by the sun which is near the horizon and those portions which are not lighted up by the sun remain almost of the same colour and medium tone as the mist why objects which are high up and at a distance are darker than the lower ones even if the mist is uniformly dense of objects standing in a mist or other dense atmosphere whether from vapour or smoke or distance those will be most visible which are the highest and among objects of equal height that will be the darkest strongest which has for background the deepest mist thus the eye h looking at a b c towers of equal height one with another sees c the top of the first tower at r at two degrees of depth in the mist and sees the height of the middle tower b through one single degree of mist therefore the top of the tower c appears stronger than the top of the tower b c of the smoke of a town smoke is seen better and more distinctly on the eastern side than on the western when the sun is in the east and this arises from two causes the first is that the sun with its rays shines through the particles of the smoke and lights them up and makes them visible the second is that the roofs of the houses seen in the east at this time are in shadow because their obliquity does not allow of their being illuminated by the sun and the same thing occurs with dust and both one and the other look the lighter in proportion as they are denser and they are densest towards the middle of smoke and dust if the sun is in the east the smoke of cities will not be visible in the west because on that side it is not seen penetrated by the solar rays nor on a dark background since the roofs of the houses turn the same side to the eye as they turn towards the sun and on this light background the smoke is not very visible but dust under the same aspect will look darker than smoke being of denser material than smoke which is moist the effect of wind on trees of representing wind in representing wind besides the bending of the boughs and the reversing of their leaves towards the quarter whence the wind comes you should also represent them amid clouds of fine dust mingled with the troubled air describe landscapes with the wind and the water and the setting and rising of the sun the wind all the leaves which hung towards the earth by the bending of the shoots with their branches are turned up side down by the gusts of wind and here their perspective is reversed for if the tree is between you and the quarter of the wind the leaves which are towards you remain in their natural aspect while those on the opposite side which ought to have their points in a contrary direction have by being turned over their points turned towards you trees struck by the force of the wind bend to the side towards which the wind is blowing and the wind being past they bend in the contrary direction that is in reverse motion that portion of a tree which is farthest from the force which strikes it is the most injured by the blow because it bears most strain thus nature has foreseen this case by thickening them in that part where they can be most hurt and most in such trees as grow to great heights as pines and the like footnote compare the sketch drawn with a pen and washed with indian ink on pl xl no in the vatican

must be inferred that the leaf as it now exists in the library of the queen of england was already separated from the original ms at the time when the vatican copy was made light and shade on clouds describe how the clouds are formed and how they dissolve and what cause raises vapour the shadows in clouds are lighter in proportion as they are nearer to the horizon footnote the drawing belonging to this was in black chalk and is totally effaced when clouds come between the sun and the eye all the upper edges of their round forms are light and towards the middle they are dark and this happens because towards the top these edges have the sun above them while you are below them and the same thing happens with the position of the branches of trees and again the clouds like the trees being somewhat transparent are lighted up in part and at the edges they show thinner but when the eye is between the cloud and the sun the cloud has the contrary effect to the former for the edges of its mass are dark and it is light towards the middle and this happens because you see the same side as faces the sun and because the edges have some transparency and reveal to the eye that portion which is hidden beyond them and which as it does not catch the sunlight like that portion turned towards it is necessarily somewhat darker again it may be that you see the details of these rounded masses from the lower side while the sun shines on the upper side and as they are not so situated as to reflect the light of the sun as in the first instance they remain dark the black clouds which are often seen higher up than those which are illuminated by the sun are shaded by other clouds lying between them and the sun again the rounded forms of the clouds that face the sun show their edges dark because they lie against the light background and to see that this is true you may look at the top of any cloud that is wholly light because it lies against the blue of the atmosphere which is darker than the cloud footnote a drawing in red chalk from the windsor collection see pl xxix representing a landscape with storm clouds may serve to illustrate this section as well as the following one of clouds smoke and dust and the flames of a furnace or of a burning kiln the clouds do not show their rounded forms excepting on the sides which face the sun on the others the roundness is imperceptible because they are in the shade footnote the text of this chapter is given in facsimile on pls xxxvi and xxxvii the two halves of the leaf form but one in the original on the margin close to lines and is the note rossore d aria inverso l orizonte of the redness of the atmosphere near the horizon the sketches on the lower portion of the page will be spoken of in no if the sun is in the east and the clouds in the west the eye placed between the sun and the clouds sees the edges of the rounded forms composing these clouds as dark and the portions which are surrounded by this dark edge are light and this occurs because the edges of the rounded forms of these clouds are turned towards the upper or lateral sky which is reflected in them both the cloud and the tree display no roundness at all on their shaded side on images reflected in water painters often deceive themselves by representing water in which they make the water reflect the objects seen by the man but the water reflects the object from one side and the man sees it from the other and it often happens that the painter sees an object from below and thus one and the same object is seen from hind part before and upside down because the water shows the image of the object in one way and the eye sees it in another of rainbows and rain the colours in the middle of the rainbow mingle together the bow in itself is not in the rain nor in the eye that sees it though it is generated by the rain the sun and the eye the rainbow is always seen by the eye that is between the rain and the body of the sun hence if the sun is in the east and the rain is in the west it will appear on the rain in the west when the air is condensed into rain it would produce a vacuum if the rest of the air did not prevent this by filling its place as it does with a violent rush and this is the wind which rises in the summer time accompanied by heavy rain of flower seeds all the flowers which turn towards the sun perfect their seeds but not the others that is to say those which get only the reflection of the sun ix the practice of painting it is hardly necessary to offer any excuses for the division carried out in the arrangement of the text into practical suggestions and theoretical enquiries it was evidently intended by leonardo himself as we conclude from incidental remarks in the mss for instance no the fact that this arrangement was never carried out either in the old ms copies or in any edition since is easily accounted for by the general disorder which results from the provisional distribution of the various chapters in the old copies we have every reason to believe that the earliest copyists in distributing the materials collected by them did not in the least consider the order in which the original ms lay before them it is evident that almost all the chapters which refer to the calling and life of the painter and which are here brought together in the first section nos may be referred to two distinct periods in leonardo s life most of them can be dated as belonging to the year or to at about this later time leonardo may have formed the project of completing his libro della pittura after an interval of some years as it would seem during which his interest in the subject had fallen somewhat into the background in the second section which treats first of the artist s studio the construction of a suitable window forms the object of careful investigations the special importance attached to this by leonardo is sufficiently obvious his theory of the incidence of light which was fully discussed in a former part of this work was to him by no means of mere abstract value but being deduced as he says from experience or experiment was required to prove its utility in practice connected with this we find suggestions for the choice of a light with practical hints as to sketching a picture and some other precepts of a practical character which must come under consideration in the course of completing the painting in all this i have followed the same principle of arrangement in the text as was carried out in the theory of painting thus the suggestions for the perspective of a picture nos are followed by the theory of light and shade for the practical method of optics nos and this by the practical precepts or the treatment of aerial perspective in the passage on portrait and figure painting the principles of painting as applied to a bust and head are separated and placed first since the advice to figure painters must have some connection with the principles of the treatment of composition by which they are followed but this arrangement of the text made it seem advisable not to pick out the practical precepts as to the representation of trees and landscape from the close connection in which they were originally placed unlike the rest of the practical precepts with the theory of this branch of the subject they must therefore be sought under the section entitled botany for painters as a supplement to the libro di pittura i have here added those texts which treat of the painter s materials as chalk drawing paper colours and their preparation of the management of oils and varnishes in the appendix are some notes on chemical substances possibly some of these if not all may have stood in connection with the preparation of colours it is in the very nature of things that leonardo s incidental indications as to colours and the like should be now a days extremely obscure and could only be explained by professional experts by them even in but few instances it might therefore have seemed advisable to reproduce exactly the original text without offering any translation the rendering here given is merely an attempt to suggest what leonardo s meaning may have been lomazzo tells us in his trattato dell arte della pittura scultura ed architettura milano libro ii cap xiv va discorrendo ed argomentando leonardo vinci in un suo libro letto da me questi anni passati ch egli scrisse di mano stanca ai prieghi di ludovico sforza duca di milano in determinazione di questa questione se e piu nobile la pittura o la scultura dicendo che quanto piu un arte porta seco fatica di corpo e sudore tanto piu e vile e men pregiata but the existence of any book specially written for lodovico il moro on the superiority of painting over sculpture is perhaps mythical the various passages in praise of painting as compared not merely with sculpture but with poetry are scattered among mss of very different dates besides the way in which the subject is discussed appears not to support the supposition that these texts were prepared at a special request of the duke i moral precepts for the student of painting how to ascertain the dispositions for an artistic career a warning concerning youths wishing to be painters many are they who have a taste and love for drawing but no talent and this will be discernible in boys who are not diligent and never finish their drawings with shading the course of instruction for an artist the youth should first learn perspective then the proportions of objects then he may copy from some good master to accustom himself to fine forms then from nature to confirm by practice the rules he has learnt then see for a time the works of various masters then get the habit of putting his art into practice and work footnote the vatican copy and numerous abridgements all place this chapter at the beginning of the trattato and in consequence dufresne and all subsequent editors have done the same in the vatican copy however all the general considerations on the relation of painting to the other arts are placed first as introductory of the order of learning to draw first draw from drawings by good masters done from works of art and from nature and not from memory then from plastic work with the guidance of the drawing done from it and then from good natural models and this you must put into practice precepts for drawing the artist ought first to exercise his hand by copying drawings from the hand of a good master and having acquired that practice under the criticism of his master he should next practise drawing objects in relief of a good style following the rules which will presently be given the study of the antique of drawing which is best to draw from nature or from the antique and which is more difficult to do outlines or light and shade it is better to imitate copy the antique than modern work footnote these are the only two passages in which leonardo alludes to the importance of antique art in the training of an artist the question asked in no remains unanswered by him and it seems to me very doubtful whether the opinion stated in no is to be regarded as a reply to it this opinion stands in the ms in a connection as will be explained later on which seems to require us to limit its application to a single special case at any rate we may suspect that when leonardo put the question he felt some hesitation as to the answer among his very numerous drawings i have not been able to find a single study from the antique though a drawing in black chalk at windsor of a man on horseback pi lxxiii may perhaps be a reminiscence of the statue of marcus aurelius at rome it seems to me that the drapery in a pen and ink drawing of a bust also at windsor has been borrowed from an antique model pl xxx g g rossi has i believe correctly interpreted leonardo s feeling towards the antique in the following note on this passage in manzi s edition p sappiamo dalla storia che i valorosi artisti toscani dell et dell oro dell arte studiarono sugli antichi marmi raccolti dal magnifico lorenzo de medici pare che il vinci a tali monumenti non si accostasse quest uomo sempre riconosce per maestra la natura e questo principio lo stringeva alla sola imitazione d essa compare no footnote the necessity of anatomical knowledge of painting it is indispensable to a painter who would be thoroughly familiar with the limbs in all the positions and actions of which they are capable in the nude to know the anatomy of the sinews bones muscles and tendons so that in their various movements and exertions he may know which nerve or muscle is the cause of each movement and show those only as prominent and thickened and not the others all over the limb as many do who to seem great draughtsmen draw their nude figures looking like wood devoid of grace so that you would think you were looking at a sack of walnuts rather than the human form or a bundle of radishes rather than the muscles of figures how it is necessary to a painter that he should know the intrinsic forms structure of man the painter who is familiar with the nature of the sinews muscles and tendons will know very well in giving movement to a limb how many and which sinews cause it and which muscle by swelling causes the contraction of that sinew and which sinews expanded into the thinnest cartilage surround and support the said muscle thus he will variously and constantly demonstrate the different muscles by means of the various attitudes of his figures and will not do as many who in a variety of movements still display the very same things modelling in the arms back breast and legs and these things are not to be regarded as minor faults how to acquire practice of study and the order of study i say that first you ought to learn the limbs and their mechanism and having this knowledge their actions should come next according to the circumstances in which they occur in man and thirdly to compose subjects the studies for which should be taken from natural actions and made from time to time as circumstances allow and pay attention to them in the streets and piazze and fields and note them down with a brief indication of the forms footnote lines explained by the lower portion of the sketch no on pl xxxi thus for a head make an o and for an arm a straight or a bent line and the same for the legs and the body footnote lines explained by the lower portion of the sketch no on pl xxxi and when you return home work out these notes in a complete form the adversary says that to acquire practice and do a great deal of work it is better that the first period of study should be employed in drawing various compositions done on paper or on walls by divers masters and that in this way practice is rapidly gained and good methods to which i reply that the method will be good if it is based on works of good composition and by skilled masters but since such masters are so rare that there are but few of them to be found it is a surer way to go to natural objects than to those which are imitated from nature with great deterioration and so form bad methods for he who can go to the fountain does not go to the water jar footnote this passage has been published by dr m jordan das malerbuck des l da vinci p his reading however varies slightly from mine industry and thoroughness the first conditions what rules should be given to boys learning to paint we know for certain that sight is one of the most rapid actions we can perform in an instant we see an infinite number of forms still we only take in thoroughly one object at a time supposing that you reader were to glance rapidly at the whole of this written page you would instantly perceive that it was covered with various letters but you could not in the time recognise what the letters were nor what they were meant to tell hence you would need to see them word by word line by line to be able to understand the letters again if you wish to go to the top of a building you must go up step by step otherwise it will be impossible that you should reach the top thus i say to you whom nature prompts to pursue this art if you wish to have a sound knowledge of the forms of objects begin with the details of them and do not go on to the second step till you have the first well fixed in memory and in practice and if you do otherwise you will throw away your time or certainly greatly prolong your studies and remember to acquire diligence rather than rapidity how that diligence accuracy should first be learnt rather than rapid execution if you who draw desire to study well and to good purpose always go slowly to work in your drawing and discriminate in the lights which have the highest degree of brightness and to what extent and likewise in the shadows which are those that are darker than the others and in what way they intermingle then their masses and the relative proportions of one to the other and note in their outlines which way they tend and which part of the lines is curved to one side or the other and where they are more or less conspicuous and consequently broad or fine and finally that your light and shade blend without strokes and borders but looking like smoke and when you have thus schooled your hand and your judgment by such diligence you will acquire rapidity before you are aware the artist s private life and choice of company of the life of the painter in the country a painter needs such mathematics as belong to painting and the absence of all companions who are alienated from his studies his brain must be easily impressed by the variety of objects which successively come before him and also free from other cares footnote leonardo here seems to be speaking of his own method of work as displayed in his mss and this passage explains at least in part the peculiarities in their arrangement and if when considering and defining one subject a second subject intervenes as happens when an object occupies the mind then he must decide which of these cases is the more difficult to work out and follow that up until it becomes quite clear and then work out the explanation of the other footnote leonardo here seems to be speaking of his own method of work as displayed in his mss and this passage explains at least in part the peculiarities in their arrangement and above all he must keep his mind as clear as the surface of a mirror which assumes colours as various as those of the different objects and his companions should be like him as to their studies and if such cannot be found he should keep his speculations to himself alone so that at last he will find no more useful company than his own footnote in the title line leonardo had originally written del pictore filosofo the philosophical painter but he himself struck out filosofo compare in no pictora notomista anatomical painter the original text is partly reproduced on pl ci of the life of the painter in his studio to the end that well being of the body may not injure that of the mind the painter or draughtsman must remain solitary and particularly when intent on those studies and reflections which will constantly rise up before his eye giving materials to be well stored in the memory while you are alone you are entirely your own master and if you have one companion you are but half your own and the less so in proportion to the indiscretion of his behaviour and if you have many companions you will fall deeper into the same trouble if you should say i will go my own way and withdraw apart the better to study the forms of natural objects i tell you you will not be able to help often listening to their chatter and so since one cannot serve two masters you will badly fill the part of a companion and carry out your studies of art even worse and if you say i will withdraw so far that their words cannot reach me and they cannot disturb me i can tell you that you will be thought mad but you see you will at any rate be alone and if you must have companions ship find it in your studio this may assist you to have the advantages which arise from various speculations all other company may be highly mischievous the distribution of time for studying of whether it is better to draw with companions or not i say and insist that drawing in company is much better than alone for many reasons the first is that you would be ashamed to be seen behindhand among the students and such shame will lead you to careful study secondly a wholesome emulation will stimulate you to be among those who are more praised than yourself and this praise of others will spur you on another is that you can learn from the drawings of others who do better than yourself and if you are better than they you can profit by your contempt for their defects while the praise of others will incite you to farther merits footnote the contradiction by this passage of the foregoing chapter is only apparent it is quite clear from the nature of the reasoning which is here used to prove that it is more improving to work with others than to work alone that the studies of pupils only are under consideration here of studying in the dark when you wake or in bed before you go to sleep i myself have proved it to be of no small use when in bed in the dark to recall in fancy the external details of forms previously studied or other noteworthy things conceived by subtle speculation and this is certainly an admirable exercise and useful for impressing things on the memory of the time for studying selection of subjects winter evenings ought to be employed by young students in looking over the things prepared during the summer that is all the drawings from the nude done in the summer should be brought together and a choice made of the best studies of limbs and bodies among them to apply in practice and commit to memory of positions after this in the following summer you should select some one who is well grown and who has not been brought up in doublets and so may not be of stiff carriage and make him go through a number of agile and graceful actions and if his muscles do not show plainly within the outlines of his limbs that does not matter at all it is enough that you can see good attitudes and you can correct the drawing of the limbs by those you studied in the winter footnote an injunction to study in the evening occurs also in no on the productive power of minor artists he is a poor disciple who does not excel his master nor is the painter praiseworthy who does but one thing well as the nude figure heads draperies animals landscapes or other such details irrespective of other work for there can be no mind so inept that after devoting itself to one single thing and doing it constantly it should fail to do it well footnote in manzi s edition p the painter g g bossi indignantly remarks on this passage parla il vince in questo luogo come se tutti gli artisti avessero quella sublimita d ingegno capace di abbracciare tutte le cose di cui era egli dotato and he then mentions the case of claude lorrain but he overlooks the fact that in leonardo s time landscape painting made no pretensions to independence but was reckoned among the details particulari lines that a painter is not admirable unless he is universal some may distinctly assert that those persons are under a delusion who call that painter a good master who can do nothing well but a head or a figure certainly this is no great achievement after studying one single thing for a life time who would not have attained some perfection in it but since we know that painting embraces and includes in itself every object produced by nature or resulting from the fortuitous actions of men in short all that the eye can see he seems to me but a poor master who can only do a figure well for do you not perceive how many and various actions are performed by men only how many different animals there are as well as trees plants flowers with many mountainous regions and plains springs and rivers cities with public and private buildings machines too fit for the purposes of men divers costumes decorations and arts and all these things ought to be regarded as of equal importance and value by the man who can be termed a good painter of the miserable pretences made by those who falsely and unworthily acquire the name of painters now there is a certain race of painters who having studied but little must need take as their standard of beauty mere gold and azure and these with supreme conceit declare that they will not give good work for miserable payment and that they could do as well as any other if they were well paid but ye foolish folks cannot such artists keep some good work and then say this is a costly work and this more moderate and this is average work and show that they can work at all prices a caution against one sided study how in important works a man should not trust entirely to his memory without condescending to draw from nature any master who should venture to boast that he could remember all the forms and effects of nature would certainly appear to me to be graced with extreme ignorance inasmuch as these effects are infinite and our memory is not extensive enough to retain them hence o painter beware lest the lust of gain should supplant in you the dignity of art for the acquisition of glory is a much greater thing than the glory of riches hence for these and other reasons which might be given first strive in drawing to represent your intention to the eye by expressive forms and the idea originally formed in your imagination then go on taking out or putting in until you have satisfied yourself then have living men draped or nude as you may have purposed in your work and take care that in dimensions and size as determined by perspective nothing is left in the work which is not in harmony with reason and the effects in nature and this will be the way to win honour in your art how to acquire universality of variety in the figures the painter should aim at universality because there is a great want of self respect in doing one thing well and another badly as many do who study only the rules of measure and proportion in the nude figure and do not seek after variety for a man may be well proportioned or he may be fat and short or tall and thin or medium and a painter who takes no account of these varieties always makes his figures on one pattern so that they might all be taken for brothers and this is a defect that demands stern reprehension how something may be learnt everywhere nature has beneficently provided that throughout the world you may find something to imitate of the means of acquiring universality it is an easy matter to men to acquire universality for all terrestrial animals resemble each other as to their limbs that is in their muscles sinews and bones and they do not vary excepting in length or in thickness as will be shown under anatomy but then there are aquatic animals which are of great variety i will not try to convince the painter that there is any rule for them for they are of infinite variety and so is the insect tribe painting the mind of the painter must resemble a mirror which always takes the colour of the object it reflects and is completely occupied by the images of as many objects as are in front of it therefore you must know oh painter that you cannot be a good one if you are not the universal master of representing by your art every kind of form produced by nature and this you will not know how to do if you do not see them and retain them in your mind hence as you go through the fields turn your attention to various objects and in turn look now at this thing and now at that collecting a store of divers facts selected and chosen from those of less value but do not do like some painters who when they are wearied with exercising their fancy dismiss their work from their thoughts and take exercise in walking for relaxation but still keep fatigue in their mind which though they see various objects around them does not apprehend them but even when they meet friends or relations and are saluted by them although they see and hear them take no more cognisance of them than if they had met so much empty air useful games and exercises of games to be played by those who draw when oh draughtsmen you desire to find relaxation in games you should always practise such things as may be of use in your profession by giving your eye good practice in judging accurately of the breadth and length of objects thus to accustom your mind to such things let one of you draw a straight line at random on a wall and each of you taking a blade of grass or of straw in his hand try to cut it to the length that the line drawn appears to him to be standing at a distance of braccia then each one may go up to the line to measure the length he has judged it to be and he who has come nearest with his measure to the length of the pattern is the best man and the winner and shall receive the prize you have settled beforehand again you should take forshortened measures that is take a spear or any other cane or reed and fix on a point at a certain distance and let each one estimate how many times he judges that its length will go into that distance again who will draw best a line one braccio long which shall be tested by a thread and such games give occasion to good practice for the eye which is of the first importance in painting a way of developing and arousing the mind to various inventions i cannot forbear to mention among these precepts a new device for study which although it may seem but trivial and almost ludicrous is nevertheless extremely useful in arousing the mind to various inventions and this is when you look at a wall spotted with stains or with a mixture of stones if you have to devise some scene you may discover a resemblance to various landscapes beautified with mountains rivers rocks trees plains wide valleys and hills in varied arrangement or again you may see battles and figures in action or strange faces and costumes and an endless variety of objects which you could reduce to complete and well drawn forms and these appear on such walls confusedly like the sound of bells in whose jangle you may find any name or word you choose to imagine ii the artist s studio instruments and helps for the application of perspective on judging of a picture on the size of the studio small rooms or dwellings discipline the mind large ones weaken it on the construction of windows the larger the wall the less the light will be the different kinds of light afforded in cellars by various forms of windows the least useful and the coldest is the window at a the most useful the lightest and warmest and most open to the sky is the window at b the window at c is of medium utility footnote from a reference to the notes on the right light for painting it becomes evident that the observations made on cellar windows have a direct bearing on the construction of the studio window in the diagram b as well as in that under no the window opening is reduced to a minimum but only it would seem in order to emphasize the advantage of walls constructed on the plan there shown of the painter s window and its advantage the painter who works from nature should have a window which he can raise and lower the reason is that sometimes you will want to finish a thing you are drawing close to the light let a b c d be the chest on which the work may be raised or lowered so that the work moves up and down and not the painter and every evening you can let down the work and shut it up above so that in the evening it may be in the fashion of a chest which when shut up may serve the purpose of a bench footnote see pl xxxi no in this plate the lines have unfortunately lost their sharpness for the accidental loss of the negative has necessitated a reproduction from a positive but having formerly published this sketch by another process in von lutzow s zeitschrift fur bildende kunst vol xvii pg i have reproduced it here in the text the sharpness of the outline in the original sketch is here preserved but it gives it from the reversed side on the best light for painting which light is best for drawing from nature whether high or low or large or small or strong and broad or strong and small or broad and weak or small and weak footnote the question here put is unanswered in the original ms of the quality of the light a broad light high up and not too strong will render the details of objects very agreeable that the light for drawing from nature should be high up the light for drawing from nature should come from the north in order that it may not vary and if you have it from the south keep the window screened with cloth so that with the sun shining the whole day the light may not vary the height of the light should be so arranged as that every object shall cast a shadow on the ground of the same length as itself the kind of light requisite for painting light and shade an object will display the greatest difference of light and shade when it is seen in the strongest light as by sunlight or at night by the light of a fire but this should not be much used in painting because the works remain crude and ungraceful an object seen in a moderate light displays little difference in the light and shade and this is the case towards evening or when the day is cloudy and works then painted are tender and every kind of face becomes graceful thus in every thing extremes are to be avoided too much light gives crudeness too little prevents our seeing the medium is best of small lights again lights cast from a small window give strong differences of light and shade all the more if the room lighted by it be large and this is not good for painting painting the luminous air which enters by passing through orifices in walls into dark rooms will render the place less dark in proportion as the opening cuts into the walls which surround and cover in the pavement of the quality of light in proportion to the number of times that a b goes into c d will it be more luminous than c d and similarly in proportion as the point e goes into c d will it be more luminous than c d and this light is useful for carvers of delicate work footnote for the same reason a window thus constructed would be convenient for an illuminator or a miniature painter footnote m ravaisson in his edition of the paris ms a remarks on this passage la figure porte les lettres f et g auxquelles rien ne renvoie dans l explication par consequent cette explication est incomplete la figure semblerait d ailleurs se rapporter a l effet de la reflexion par un miroir concave so far as i can see the text is not imperfect nor is the sense obscure it is hardly necessary to observe that c d here indicate the wall of the room opposite to the window e and the semicircle described by f g stands for the arch of the sky this occurs in various diagrams for example under a similar semicircle pl iii no and compare no is expressly called orizonte in writing that the light should fall upon a picture from one window only this may be seen in the case of objects in this form if you want to represent a round ball at a certain height you must make it oval in this shape and stand so far off as that by foreshortening it appears round of selecting the light which gives most grace to faces if you should have a court yard that you can at pleasure cover with a linen awning that light will be good or when you want to take a portrait do it in dull weather or as evening falls making the sitter stand with his back to one of the walls of the court yard note in the streets as evening falls the faces of the men and women and when the weather is dull what softness and delicacy you may perceive in them hence oh painter have a court arranged with the walls tinted black and a narrow roof projecting within the walls it should be braccia wide and braccia long and braccia high and covered with a linen awning or else paint a work towards evening or when it is cloudy or misty and this is a perfect light on various helps in preparing a picture to draw a nude figure from nature or any thing else hold in your hand a plumb line to enable you to judge of the relative position of objects of drawing an object when you draw take care to set up a principal line which you must observe all throughout the object you are drawing every thing should bear relation to the direction of this principal line of a mode of drawing a place accurately have a piece of glass as large as a half sheet of royal folio paper and set thus firmly in front of your eyes that is between your eye and the thing you want to draw then place yourself at a distance of of a braccia from the glass fixing your head with a machine in such a way that you cannot move it at all then shut or entirely cover one eye and with a brush or red chalk draw upon the glass that which you see beyond it then trace it on paper from the glass afterwards transfer it onto good paper and paint it if you like carefully attending to the arial perspective how to learn to place your figures correctly if you want to acquire a practice of good and correct attitudes for your figures make a square frame or net and square it out with thread place this between your eye and the nude model you are drawing and draw these same squares on the paper on which you mean to draw the figure but very delicately then place a pellet of wax on a spot of the net which will serve as a fixed point which whenever you look at your model must cover the pit of the throat or if his back is turned it may cover one of the vertebrae of the neck thus these threads will guide you as to each part of the body which in any given attitude will be found below the pit of the throat or the angles of the shoulders or the nipples or hips and other parts of the body and the transverse lines of the net will show you how much the figure is higher over the leg on which it is posed than over the other and the same with the hips and the knees and the feet but always fix the net perpendicularly so that all the divisions that you see the model divided into by the net work correspond with your drawing of the model on the net work you have sketched the squares you draw may be as much smaller than those of the net as you wish that your figure should be smaller than nature afterwards remember when drawing figures to use the rule of the corresponding proportions of the limbs as you have learnt it from the frame and net this should be braccia and a half high and braccia wide braccia distant from you and braccio from the model footnote leonardo is commonly credited with the invention of the arrangement of a plate of glass commonly known as the vertical plane professor e von brucke in his bruchstucke aus der theorie der bildenden kunste leipzig pg writes on this contrivance unsere glastafel ist die sogenannte glastafel des leonardo da vinci die in gestalt einer glastafel vorgestellte bildflache a method of drawing an object in relief at night place a sheet of not too transparent paper between the relievo and the light and you can draw thus very well footnote bodies thus illuminated will show on the surface of the paper how the copyist has to distribute light and shade if you want to represent a figure on a wall the wall being foreshortened while the figure is to appear in its proper form and as standing free from the wall you must proceed thus have a thin plate of iron and make a small hole in the centre this hole must be round set a light close to it in such a position as that it shines through the central hole then place any object or figure you please so close to the wall that it touches it and draw the outline of the shadow on the wall then fill in the shade and add the lights place the person who is to see it so that he looks through that same hole where at first the light was and you will never be able to persuade yourself that the image is not detached from the wall footnote uno piccolo spiracelo nel mezzo m ravaisson in his edition of ms a paris p reads nel muro evidently a mistake for nel mezzo which is quite plainly written and he translates it fait lui une petite ouverture dans le mur adding in a note les mots dans le mur paraissent etre de trop leonardo a du les ecrire par distraction but nel mezzo is clearly legible even on the photograph facsimile given by ravaisson himself and the objection he raises disappears at once it is not always wise or safe to try to prove our author s absence of mind or inadvertence by apparent difficulties in the sense or connection of the text to draw a figure on a wall braccia high which shall look braccia high if you wish to draw a figure or any other object to look braccia high you must do it in this way first on the surface m r draw half the man you wish to represent then the other half then put on the vault m n the rest of the figure spoken of above first set out the vertical plane on the floor of a room of the same shape as the wall with the coved part on which you are to paint your figure then behind it draw a figure set out in profile of whatever size you please and draw lines from it to the point f and as these lines cut m n on the vertical plane so will the figure come on the wall of which the vertical plane gives a likeness and you will have all the relative heights and prominences of the figure and the breadth or thickness which are on the upright wall m n are to be drawn in their proper form since as the wall recedes the figure will be foreshortened by itself but that part of the figure which goes into the cove you must foreshorten as if it were standing upright this diminution you must

surface of a wall to guide him in drawing the figure pariete di rilieuo sur une parai en relief ravaisson auf einer schnittlinie zum aufrichten ludwig the explanation of this puzzling expression must be sought in no lines footnote see pl xxxi the second sketch which in the plate is incomplete is here reproduced and completed from the original to illustrate the text in the original the larger diagram is placed between lines and c a a a has the similar heading del cressciere della figura and the text begins se voli fare a figura grande b c but here it breaks off the translation here given renders the meaning of the passage as i think it must be understood the ms is perfectly legible and the construction of the sentence is simple and clear difficulties can only arise from the very fullness of the meaning particularly towards the end of the passage if you would to draw a cube in an angle of a wall first draw the object in its own proper shape and raise it onto a vertical plane until it resembles the angle in which the said object is to be represented why are paintings seen more correctly in a mirror than out of it how the mirror is the master and guide of painters when you want to see if your picture corresponds throughout with the objects you have drawn from nature take a mirror and look in that at the reflection of the real things and compare the reflected image with your picture and consider whether the subject of the two images duly corresponds in both particularly studying the mirror you should take the mirror for your guide that is to say a flat mirror because on its surface the objects appear in many respects as in a painting thus you see in a painting done on a flat surface objects which appear in relief and in the mirror also a flat surface they look the same the picture has one plane surface and the same with the mirror the picture is intangible in so far as that which appears round and prominent cannot be grasped in the hands and it is the same with the mirror and since you can see that the mirror by means of outlines shadows and lights makes objects appear in relief you who have in your colours far stronger lights and shades than those in the mirror can certainly if you compose your picture well make that also look like a natural scene reflected in a large mirror footnote i understand the concluding lines of this passage as follows if you draw the upper half a figure on a large sheet of paper laid out on the floor of a room sala be piana to the same scale con le sue vere grosseze as the lower half already drawn upon the wall lines you must then reduce them on a pariete di rilievo a curved vertical plane which serves as a model to reproduce the form of the vault of judging your own pictures we know very well that errors are better recognised in the works of others than in our own and that often while reproving little faults in others you may ignore great ones in yourself to avoid such ignorance in the first place make yourself a master of perspective then acquire perfect knowledge of the proportions of men and other animals and also study good architecture that is so far as concerns the forms of buildings and other objects which are on the face of the earth these forms are infinite and the better you know them the more admirable will your work be and in cases where you lack experience do not shrink from drawing them from nature but to carry out my promise above in the title i say that when you paint you should have a flat mirror and often look at your work as reflected in it when you will see it reversed and it will appear to you like some other painter s work so you will be better able to judge of its faults than in any other way again it is well that you should often leave off work and take a little relaxation because when you come back to it you are a better judge for sitting too close at work may greatly deceive you again it is good to retire to a distance because the work looks smaller and your eye takes in more of it at a glance and sees more easily the discords or disproportion in the limbs and colours of the objects on the management of works of a method of learning well by heart when you want to know a thing you have studied in your memory proceed in this way when you have drawn the same thing so many times that you think you know it by heart test it by drawing it without the model but have the model traced on flat thin glass and lay this on the drawing you have made without the model and note carefully where the tracing does not coincide with your drawing and where you find you have gone wrong and bear in mind not to repeat the same mistakes then return to the model and draw the part in which you were wrong again and again till you have it well in your mind if you have no flat glass for tracing on take some very thin kidts kin parchment well oiled and dried and when you have used it for one drawing you can wash it clean with a sponge and make a second that a painter ought to be curious to hear the opinions of every one on his work certainly while a man is painting he ought not to shrink from hearing every opinion for we know very well that a man though he may not be a painter is familiar with the forms of other men and very capable of judging whether they are hump backed or have one shoulder higher or lower than the other or too big a mouth or nose and other defects and as we know that men are competent to judge of the works of nature how much more ought we to admit that they can judge of our errors since you know how much a man may be deceived in his own work and if you are not conscious of this in yourself study it in others and profit by their faults therefore be curious to hear with patience the opinions of others consider and weigh well whether those who find fault have ground or not for blame and if so amend but if not make as though you had not heard or if he should be a man you esteem show him by argument the cause of his mistake on the limitations of painting how in small objects errors are less evident than in large ones in objects of minute size the extent of error is not so perceptible as in large ones and the reason is that if this small object is a representation of a man or of some other animal from the immense diminution the details cannot be worked out by the artist with the finish that is requisite hence it is not actually complete and not being complete its faults cannot be determined for instance look at a man at a distance of braccia and judge attentively whether he be handsome or ugly or very remarkable or of ordinary appearance you will find that with the utmost effort you cannot persuade yourself to decide and the reason is that at such a distance the man is so much diminished that the character of the details cannot be determined and if you wish to see how much this man is diminished by distance hold one of your fingers at a span s distance from your eye and raise or lower it till the top joint touches the feet of the figure you are looking at and you will see an incredible reduction for this reason we often doubt as to the person of a friend at a distance why a painting can never appear detached as natural objects do painters often fall into despair of imitating nature when they see their pictures fail in that relief and vividness which objects have that are seen in a mirror while they allege that they have colours which for brightness or depth far exceed the strength of light and shade in the reflections in the mirror thus displaying their own ignorance rather than the real cause because they do not know it it is impossible that painted objects should appear in such relief as to resemble those reflected in the mirror although both are seen on a flat surface unless they are seen with only one eye and the reason is that two eyes see one object behind another as a and b see m and n m cannot exactly occupy the space of n because the base of the visual lines is so broad that the second body is seen beyond the first but if you close one eye as at s the body f will conceal r because the line of sight proceeds from a single point and makes its base in the first body whence the second of the same size can never be seen footnote this passage contains the solution of the problem proposed in no lines leonardo was evidently familiar with the law of optics on which the construction of the stereoscope depends compare e von brucke bruchstucke aus der theorie der bildenden kunste pg schon leonardo da vinci wusste dass ein noch so gut gemaltes bild nie den vollen eindruck der korperlichkeit geben kann wie ihn die natur selbst giebt er erklart dies auch in kap liii und kap cccxli ed du fresne des trattato in sachgemasser weise aus dem sehen mit beiden augen chap of du fresne s edition corresponds to no of this work why of two objects of equal size a painted one will look larger than a solid one the reason of this is not so easy to demonstrate as many others still i will endeavour to accomplish it if not wholly at any rate in part the perspective of diminution demonstrates by reason that objects diminish in proportion as they are farther from the eye and this reasoning is confirmed by experience hence the lines of sight that extend between the object and the eye when they are directed to the surface of a painting are all intersected at uniform limits while those lines which are directed towards a piece of sculpture are intersected at various limits and are of various lengths the lines which are longest extend to a more remote limb than the others and therefore that limb looks smaller as there are numerous lines each longer than the others since there are numerous parts each more remote than the others and these being farther off necessarily appear smaller and by appearing smaller it follows that their diminution makes the whole mass of the object look smaller but this does not occur in painting since the lines of sight all end at the same distance there can be no diminution hence the parts not being diminished the whole object is undiminished and for this reason painting does not diminish as a piece of sculpture does on the choice of a position how high the point of sight should be placed the point of sight must be at the level of the eye of an ordinary man and the farthest limit of the plain where it touches the sky must be placed at the level of that line where the earth and sky meet excepting mountains which are independent of it of the way to draw figures for historical pictures the painter must always study on the wall on which he is to picture a story the height of the position where he wishes to arrange his figures and when drawing his studies for them from nature he must place himself with his eye as much below the object he is drawing as in the picture it will have to be above the eye of the spectator otherwise the work will look wrong the apparent size of figures in a picture of placing a figure in the foreground of a historical picture you must make the foremost figure in the picture less than the size of nature in proportion to the number of braccia at which you place it from the front line and make the others in proportion by the above rule perspective you are asked o painter why the figures you draw on a small scale according to the laws of perspective do not appear notwithstanding the demonstration of distance as large as real ones their height being the same as in those painted on the wall and why painted objects seen at a small distance appear larger than the real ones the right position of the artist when painting and of the spectator of painting when you draw from nature stand at a distance of times the height of the object you wish to draw of drawing from relief in drawing from the round the draughtsman should so place himself that the eye of the figure he is drawing is on a level with his own this should be done with any head he may have to represent from nature because without exception the figures or persons you meet in the streets have their eyes on the same level as your own and if you place them higher or lower you will see that your drawing will not be true why groups of figures one above another are to be avoided the universal practice which painters adopt on the walls of chapels is greatly and reasonably to be condemned inasmuch as they represent one historical subject on one level with a landscape and buildings and then go up a step and paint another varying the point of sight and then a third and a fourth in such a way as that on one wall there are points of sight which is supreme folly in such painters we know that the point of sight is opposite the eye of the spectator of the scene and if you would have me tell you how to represent the life of a saint divided into several pictures on one and the same wall i answer that you must set out the foreground with its point of sight on a level with the eye of the spectator of the scene and upon this plane represent the more important part of the story large and then diminishing by degrees the figures and the buildings on various hills and open spaces you can represent all the events of the history and on the remainder of the wall up to the top put trees large as compared with the figures or angels if they are appropriate to the story or birds or clouds or similar objects otherwise do not trouble yourself with it for your whole work will be wrong a picture of objects in perspective will look more lifelike when seen from the point from which the objects were drawn if you want to represent an object near to you which is to have the effect of nature it is impossible that your perspective should not look wrong with every false relation and disagreement of proportion that can be imagined in a wretched work unless the spectator when he looks at it has his eye at the very distance and height and direction where the eye or the point of sight was placed in doing this perspective hence it would be necessary to make a window or rather a hole of the size of your face through which you can look at the work and if you do this beyond all doubt your work if it is correct as to light and shade will have the effect of nature nay you will hardly persuade yourself that those objects are painted otherwise do not trouble yourself about it unless indeed you make your view at least times as far off as the greatest width or height of the objects represented and this will satisfy any spectator placed anywhere opposite to the picture if you want the proof briefly shown take a piece of wood in the form of a little column eight times as high as it is thick like a column without any plinth or capital then mark off on a flat wall equal spaces equal to its width so that between them they make columns resembling your little column you then must fix opposite the centre space and at braccia from the wall a thin strip of iron with a small round hole in the middle about as large as a big pearl close to this hole place a light touching it then place your column against each mark on the wall and draw the outline of its shadow afterwards shade it and look through the hole in the iron plate footnote in the original there is a wide space between lines and in which we find two sketches not belonging to the text it is unnecessary to give prominence to the points in which my reading differs from that of m ravaisson or to justify myself since they are all of secondary importance and can also be immediately verified from the photograph facsimile in his edition a diminished object should be seen from the same distance height and direction as the point of sight of your eye or else your knowledge will produce no good effect and if you will not or cannot act on this principle because as the plane on which you paint is to be seen by several persons you would need several points of sight which would make it look discordant and wrong place yourself at a distance of at least times the size of the objects the lesser fault you can fall into then will be that of representing all the objects in the foreground of their proper size and on whichever side you are standing the objects thus seen will diminish themselves while the spaces between them will have no definite ratio for if you place yourself in the middle of a straight row of objects and look at several columns arranged in a line you will see beyond a few columns separated by intervals that the columns touch and beyond where they touch they cover each other till the last column projects but very little beyond the last but one thus the spaces between the columns are by degrees entirely lost so if your method of perspective is good it will produce the same effect this effect results from standing near the line in which the columns are placed this method is not satisfactory unless the objects seen are viewed from a small hole in the middle of which is your point of sight but if you proceed thus your work will be perfect and will deceive the beholder who will see the columns as they are here figured here the eye is in the middle at the point a and near to the columns footnote the diagram which stands above this chapter in the original with the note belonging to it a b e la ripruova a b is the proof has obviously no connection with the text the second sketch alone is reproduced and stands in the original between lines and if you cannot arrange that those who look at your work should stand at one particular point when constructing your work stand back until your eye is at least times as far off as the greatest height and width of your work this will make so little difference when the eye of the spectator moves that it will be hardly appreciable and it will look very good if the point of sight is at t you would make the figures on the circle d b e all of one size as each of them bears the same relation to the point t but consider the diagram given below and you will see that this is wrong and why i shall make b smaller than d e footnote the second diagram of this chapter stands in the original between lines and it is easy to understand that if objects equal to each other are placed side by side the one at braccia distance looks smaller than that placed at braccia this however is rather theoretical than for practice because you stand close by footnote instead of se preso sie presso m ravaisson reads sempre se which gives rise to the unmeaning rendering parceque toujours all the objects in the foreground whether large or small are to be drawn of their proper size and if you see them from a distance they will appear just as they ought and if you see them close they will diminish of themselves footnote compare no line take care that the vertical plan on which you work out the perspective of the objects seen is of the same form as the wall on which the work is to be executed of painting the size of the figures represented ought to show you the distance they are seen from if you see a figure as large as nature you know it appears to be close to the eye where a spectator should stand to look at a picture supposing a b to be the picture and d to be the light i say that if you place yourself between c and e you will not understand the picture well and particularly if it is done in oils or still more if it is varnished because it will be lustrous and somewhat of the nature of a mirror and for this reason the nearer you go towards the point c the less you will see because the rays of light falling from the window on the picture are reflected to that point but if you place yourself between e and d you will get a good view of it and the more so as you approach the point d because that spot is least exposed to these reflected rays of light iii the practical methods of light and shade and aerial perspective gradations of light and shade of painting of the darkness of the shadows or i may say the brightness of the lights although practical painters attribute to all shaded objects trees fields hair beards and skin four degrees of darkness in each colour they use that is to say first a dark foundation secondly a spot of colour somewhat resembling the form of the details thirdly a somewhat brighter and more defined portion fourthly the lights which are more conspicuous than other parts of the figure still to me it appears that these gradations are infinite upon a continuous surface which is in itself infinitely divisible and i prove it thus footnote see pl xxxi no the two upper sketches let a g be a continuous surface and let d be the light which illuminates it i say by the th proposition which says that that side of an illuminated body is most highly lighted which is nearest to the source of light that therefore g must be darker than c in proportion as the line d g is longer than the line d c and consequently that these gradations of light or rather of shadow are not only but may be conceived of as infinite because c d is a continuous surface and every continuous surface is infinitely divisible hence the varieties in the length of lines extending between the light and the illuminated object are infinite and the proportion of the light will be the same as that of the length of the lines between them extending from the centre of the luminous body to the surface of the illuminated object on the choice of light for a picture how the painter must place himself with reference to the light to give the effect of relief let a b be the window m the point of light i say that on whichever side the painter places himself he will be well placed if only his eye is between the shaded and the illuminated portions of the object he is drawing and this place you will find by putting yourself between the point m and the division between the shadow and the light on the object to be drawn that shadows cast by a particular light should be avoided because they are equally strong at the ends and at the beginning the shadows cast by the sun or any other particular light have not a pleasing effect on the body to which they belong because the parts remain confuse being divided by distinct outlines of light and shade and the shadows are of equal strength at the end and at the beginning how light should be thrown upon figures the light must be arranged in accordance with the natural conditions under which you wish to represent your figures that is if you represent them in the sunshine make the shadows dark with large spaces of light and mark their shadows and those of all the surrounding objects strongly on the ground and if you represent them as in dull weather give little difference of light and shade without any shadows at their feet if you represent them as within doors make a strong difference between the lights and shadows with shadows on the ground if the window is screened and the walls white there will be little difference of light if it is lighted by firelight make the high lights ruddy and strong and the shadows dark and those cast on the walls and on the floor will be clearly defined and the farther they are from the body the broader and longer will they be if the light is partly from the fire and partly from the outer day that of day will be the stronger and that of the fire almost as red as fire itself above all see that the figures you paint are broadly lighted and from above that is to say all living persons that you paint for you will see that all the people you meet out in the street are lighted from above and you must know that if you saw your most intimate friend with a light on his face from below you would find it difficult to recognise him of helping the apparent relief of a picture by giving it artificial light and shade to increase relief of a picture you may place between your figure and the solid object on which its shadow falls a line of bright light dividing the figure from the object in shadow and on the same object you shall represent two light parts which will surround the shadow cast upon the wall by the figure placed opposite and do this frequently with the limbs which you wish should stand out somewhat from the body they belong to particularly when the arms cross the front of the breast show between the shadow cast by the arms on the breast and the shadow on the arms themselves a little light seeming to fall through a space between the breast and the arms and the more you wish the arm to look detached from the breast the broader you must make the light always contrive also to arrange the figures against the background in such a way as that the parts in shadow are against a light background and the illuminated portions against a dark background footnote compare the two diagrams under no of situation remember to note the situation of your figures for the light and shade will be one thing if the object is in a dark place with a particular light and another thing if it is in a light place with direct sunlight one thing in a dark place with a diffused evening light or a cloudy sky and another in the diffused light of the atmosphere lighted by the sun of the judgment to be made of a painter s work first you must consider whether the figures have the relief required by their situation and the light which illuminates them for the shadows should not be the same at the extreme ends of the composition as in the middle because it is one thing when figures are surrounded by shadows and another when they have shadows only on one side those which are in the middle of the picture are surrounded by shadows because they are shaded by the figures which stand between them and the light and those are lighted on one side only which stand between the principal group and the light because where they do not look towards the light they face the group and the darkness of the group is thrown on them and where they do not face the group they face the brilliant light and it is their own darkness shadowing them which appears there in the second place observe the distribution or arrangement of figures and whether they are distributed appropriately to the circumstances of the story thirdly whether the figures are actively intent on their particular business of the treatment of the lights first give a general shadow to the whole of that extended part which is away from the light then put in the half shadows and the strong shadows comparing them with each other and in the same way give the extended light in half tint afterwards adding the half lights and the high lights likewise comparing them together the distribution of light and shade of shadows on bodies when you represent the dark shadows in bodies in light and shade always show the cause of the shadow and the same with reflections because the dark shadows are produced by dark objects and the reflections by objects only moderately lighted that is with diminished light and there is the same proportion between the highly lighted part of a body and the part lighted by a reflection as between the origin of the lights on the body and the origin of the reflections of lights and shadows i must remind you to take care that every portion of a body and every smallest detail which is ever so little in relief must be given its proper importance as to light and shade of the way to make the shadow on figures correspond to the light and to the colour of the body when you draw a figure and you wish to see whether the shadow is the proper complement to the light and neither redder nor yellower than is the nature of the colour you wish to represent in shade proceed thus cast a shadow with your finger on the illuminated portion and if the accidental shadow that you have made is like the natural shadow cast by your finger on your work well and good and by putting your finger nearer or farther off you can make darker or lighter shadows which you must compare with your own of surrounding bodies by various forms of shadow take care that the shadows cast upon the surface of the bodies by different objects must undulate according to the various curves of the limbs which cast the shadows and of the objects on which they are cast the juxtaposition of light and shade on painting the comparison of the various qualities of shadows and lights not infrequently seems ambiguous and confused to the painter who desires to imitate and copy the objects he sees the reason is this if you see a white drapery side by side with a black one that part of the white drapery which lies against the black one will certainly look much whiter than the part which lies against something whiter than itself footnote it is evident from this that so early as in leonardo s writing in perspective was so far advanced that he could quote his own statements as bearing on this subject compare what is said in no and the reason of this is shown in my book on perspective of shadows where a shadow ends in the light note carefully where it is paler or deeper and where it is more or less indistinct towards the light and above all in painting youthful figures i remind you not to make the shadow end like a stone because flesh has a certain transparency as may be seen by looking at a hand held between the eye and the sun which shines through it ruddy and bright place the most highly coloured part between the light and shadow and to see what shadow tint is needed on the flesh cast a shadow on it with your finger and according as you wish to see it lighter or darker hold your finger nearer to or farther from your picture and copy that shadow on the lighting of the background of the backgrounds for painted figures the ground which surrounds the forms of any object you paint should be darker than the high lights of those figures and lighter than their shadowed part c of the background that the painter should adopt in his works since experience shows us that all bodies are surrounded by light and shade it is necessary that you o painter should so arrange that the side which is in light shall terminate against a dark body and likewise that the shadow side shall terminate against a light body and by following this rule you will add greatly to the relief of your figures a most important part of painting consists in the backgrounds of the objects represented against these backgrounds the outlines of those natural objects which are convex are always visible and also the forms of these bodies against the background even though the colours of the bodies should be the same as that of the background this is caused by the convex edges of the objects not being illuminated in the same way as by the same light the background is illuminated since these edges will often be lighter or darker than the background but if the edge is of the same colour as the background beyond a doubt it will in that part of the picture interfere with your perception of the outline and such a choice in a picture ought to be rejected by the judgment of good painters inasmuch as the purpose of the painter is to make his figures appear detached from the background while in the case here described the contrary occurs not only in the picture but in the objects themselves that you ought when representing objects above the eye and on one side if you wish them to look detached from the wall to show between the shadow on the object and the shadow it casts a middle light so that the body will appear to stand away from the wall on the lighting of white objects how white bodies should be represented if you are representing a white body let it be surrounded by ample space because as white has no colour of its own it is tinged and altered in some degree by the colour of the objects surrounding it if you see a woman dressed in white in the midst of a landscape that side which is towards the sun is bright in colour so much so that in some portions it will dazzle the eyes like the sun itself and the side which is towards the atmosphere luminous through being interwoven with the sun s rays and penetrated by them since the atmosphere itself is blue that side of the woman s figure will appear steeped in blue if the surface of the ground about her be meadows and if she be standing between a field lighted up by the sun and the sun itself you will see every portion of those folds which are towards the meadow tinged by the reflected rays with the colour of that meadow thus the white is transmuted into the colours of the luminous and of the non luminous objects near it the methods of aerial why faces seen at a distance look dark we see quite plainly that all the images of visible objects that lie before us whether large or small reach our sense by the minute aperture of the eye and if through so small a passage the image can pass of the vast extent of sky and earth the face of a man being by comparison with such large images almost nothing by reason of the distance which diminishes it fills up so little of the eye that it is indistinguishable having also to be transmitted from the surface to the sense through a dark medium that is to say the crystalline lens which looks dark this image not being strong in colour becomes affected by this darkness on its passage and on reaching the sense it appears dark no other reason can in any way be assigned if the point in the eye is black it is because it is full of a transparent humour as clear as air and acts like a perforation in a board on looking into it it appears dark and the objects seen through the bright air and a dark one become confused in this darkness why a man seen at a certain distance is not recognisable the perspective of diminution shows us that the farther away an object is the smaller it looks if you look at a man at a distance from you of an arrow s flight and hold the eye of a small needle close to your own eye you can see through it several men whose images are transmitted to the eye and will all be comprised within the size of the needle s eye hence if the man who is at the distance of an arrow s flight can send his whole image to your eye occupying only a small space in the needle s eye how can you expect in so small a figure to distinguish or see the nose or mouth or any detail of his person and not seeing these you cannot recognise the man since these features which he does not show are what give men different aspects the reason why small figures should not be made finished i say that the reason that objects appear diminished in size is because they are remote from the eye this being the case it is evident that there must be a great extent of atmosphere between the eye and the objects and this air interferes with the distinctness of the forms of the object hence the minute details of these objects will be indistinguishable and unrecognisable therefore o painter make your smaller figures merely indicated and not highly finished otherwise you will produce effects the opposite to nature your supreme guide the object is small by reason of the great distance between it and the eye this great distance is filled with air that mass of air forms a dense body which intervenes and prevents the eye seeing the minute details of objects whenever a figure is placed at a considerable distance you lose first the distinctness of the smallest parts while the larger parts are left to the last losing all distinctness of detail and outline and what remains is an oval or spherical figure with confused edges of painting the density of a body of smoke looks white below the horizon while above the horizon it is dark even if the smoke is in itself of a uniform colour this uniformity will vary according to the variety in the ground on which it is seen iv of portrait and figure painting of sketching figures and portraits of the way to learn to compose figures in groups in historical pictures when you have well learnt perspective and have by heart the parts and forms of objects you must go about and constantly as you go observe note and consider the circumstances and behaviour of men in talking quarrelling or laughing or fighting together the action of the men themselves and the actions of the bystanders who separate them or who look on and take a note of them with slight strokes thus in a little book which you should always carry with you and it should be of tinted paper that it may not be rubbed out but change the old when full for a new one since these things should not be rubbed out but preserved with great care for the forms and positions of objects are so infinite that the memory is incapable of retaining them wherefore keep these sketches as your guides and masters footnote among leonardo s numerous note books of pocket size not one has coloured paper so no sketches answering to this description can be pointed out the fact that most of the notes are written in ink militates against the supposition that they were made in the open air of a method of keeping in mind the form of a face if you want to acquire facility for bearing in mind the expression of a face first make yourself familiar with a variety of forms of several heads eyes noses mouths chins and cheeks and necks and shoulders and to put a case noses are of types straight bulbous hollow prominent above or below the middle aquiline regular flat round or pointed these hold good as to profile in full face they are of types these are equal thick in the middle thin in the middle with the tip thick and the root narrow or narrow at the tip and wide at the root with the nostrils wide or narrow high or low and the openings wide or hidden by the point and you will find an equal variety in the other details which things you must draw from nature and fix them in your mind or else when you have to draw a face by heart carry with you a little book in which you have noted such features and when you have cast a glance at the face of the person you wish to draw you can look in private which nose or mouth is most like or there make a little mark to recognise it again at home of grotesque faces i need say nothing because they are kept in mind without difficulty the position of the head how you should set to work to draw a head of which all the parts shall agree with the position given to it to draw a head in which the features shall agree with the turn and bend of the head pursue this method you know that the eyes eyebrows nostrils corners of the mouth and sides of the chin the jaws cheeks ears and all the parts of a face are squarely and straightly set upon the face footnote compare the drawings and the text belonging to them on pl ix no pl x no pl xl no and pl xii no therefore when you have sketched the face draw lines passing from one corner of the eye to the other and so for the placing of each feature and after having drawn the ends of the lines beyond the two sides of the face look if the spaces inside the same parallel lines on the right and on the left are equal but be sure to remember to make these lines tend to the point of sight footnote see pl xxxi no the slight sketch on the left hand side the text of this passage is written by the side of it in this sketch the lines seem intentionally incorrect and converging to the right compare i instead of parallel compare too with this text the drawing in red chalk from windsor castle which is reproduced on pl xl no of the light on the face how to know which side of an object is to be more or less luminous than the other let f be the light the head will be the object illuminated by it and that side of the head on which the rays fall most directly will be the most highly lighted and those parts on which the rays fall most aslant will be less lighted the light falls as a blow might since a blow which falls perpendicularly falls with the greatest force and when it falls obliquely it is less forcible than the former in proportion to the width of the angle exempli gratia if you throw a ball at a wall of which the extremities are equally far from you the blow will fall straight and if you throw the ball at the wall when standing at one end of it the ball will hit it obliquely and the blow will not tell footnote see pl xxxi no the sketch on the right hand side the proof and reason why among the illuminated parts certain portions are in higher light than others since it is proved that every definite light is or seems to be derived from one single point the side illuminated by it will have its highest light on the portion where the line of radiance falls perpendicularly as is shown above in the lines a g and also in a h and in l a and that portion of the illuminated side will be least luminous where the line of incidence strikes it between two more dissimilar angles as is seen at b c d and by this means you may also know which parts are deprived of light as is seen at m k where the angles made by the lines of incidence are most equal there will be the highest light and where they are most unequal it will be darkest i will make further mention of the reason of reflections footnote see pl xxxii the text here given

suggestions for historical pictures when you compose a historical picture take two points one the point of sight and the other the source of light and make this as distant as possible historical pictures ought not to be crowded and confused with too many figures precepts in painting let you sketches of historical pictures be swift and the working out of the limbs not be carried too far but limited to the position of the limbs which you can afterwards finish as you please and at your leisure footnote see pl xxxviii no the pen and ink drawing given there as no may also be compared with this passage it is in the windsor collection where it is numbered the sorest misfortune is when your views are in advance of your work of composing historical pictures of not considering the limbs in the figures in historical pictures as many do who in the wish to represent the whole of a figure spoil their compositions and when you place one figure behind another take care to draw the whole of it so that the limbs which come in front of the nearer figures may stand out in their natural size and place how to represent the differences of age and sex how the ages of man should be depicted that is infancy childhood youth manhood old age decrepitude footnote no answer is here given to this question in the original ms old men ought to be represented with slow and heavy movements their legs bent at the knees when they stand still and their feet placed parallel and apart bending low with the head leaning forward and their arms but little extended women must be represented in modest attitudes their legs close together their arms closely folded their heads inclined and somewhat on one side old women should be represented with eager swift and furious gestures like infernal furies but the action should be more violent in their arms and head than in their legs little children with lively and contorted movements when sitting and when standing still in shy and timid attitudes footnote bracci raccolte compare pl xxxiii this drawing in silver point on yellowish tinted paper the lights heightened with white represents two female hands laid together in a lap above is a third finished study of a right hand apparently holding a veil from the head across the bosom this drawing evidently dates from before and was very probably done at florence perhaps as a preparatory study for some picture the type of hand with its slender thin forms is more like the style of the vierge aux rochers in the louvre than any later works as the mona lisa for instance of representing the emotions that a figure is not admirable unless it expresses by its action the passion of its sentiment that figure is most admirable which by its actions best expresses the passion that animates it how an angry man is to be figured you must make an angry person holding someone by the hair wrenching his head against the ground and with one knee on his ribs his right arm and fist raised on high his hair must be thrown up his brow downcast and knit his teeth clenched and the two corners of his mouth grimly set his neck swelled and bent forward as he leans over his foe and full of furrows how to represent a man in despair you must show a man in despair with a knife having already torn open his garments and with one hand tearing open the wound and make him standing on his feet and his legs somewhat bent and his whole person leaning towards the earth his hair flying in disorder of representing imaginary animals how you should make an imaginary animal look natural you know that you cannot invent animals without limbs each of which in itself must resemble those of some other animal hence if you wish to make an animal imagined by you appear natural let us say a dragon take for its head that of a mastiff or hound with the eyes of a cat the ears of a porcupine the nose of a greyhound the brow of a lion the temples of an old cock the neck of a water tortoise footnote the sketch here inserted of two men on horseback fighting a dragon is the facsimile of a pen and ink drawing belonging to baron edmond de rothschild of paris the selection of forms of the delusions which arise in judging of the limbs a painter who has clumsy hands will paint similar hands in his works and the same will occur with any limb unless long study has taught him to avoid it therefore o painter look carefully what part is most ill favoured in your own person and take particular pains to correct it in your studies for if you are coarse your figures will seem the same and devoid of charm and it is the same with any part that may be good or poor in yourself it will be shown in some degree in your figures of the selection of beautiful faces it seems to me to be no small charm in a painter when he gives his figures a pleasing air and this grace if he have it not by nature he may acquire by incidental study in this way look about you and take the best parts of many beautiful faces of which the beauty is confirmed rather by public fame than by your own judgment for you might be mistaken and choose faces which have some resemblance to your own for it would seem that such resemblances often please us and if you should be ugly you would select faces that were not beautiful and you would then make ugly faces as many painters do for often a master s work resembles himself so select beauties as i tell you and fix them in your mind of the limbs which ought to be carefully selected and of all the other parts with regard to painting when selecting figures you should choose slender ones rather than lean and wooden ones of the muscles of animals the hollow spaces interposed between the muscles must not be of such a character as that the skin should seem to cover two sticks laid side by side like c nor should they seem like two sticks somewhat remote from such contact so that the skin hangs in an empty loose curve as at f but it should be like i laid over the spongy fat that lies in the angles as the angle n m o which angle is formed by the contact of the ends of the muscles and as the skin cannot fold down into such an angle nature has filled up such angles with a small quantity of spongy and as i may say vesicular fat with minute bladders in it full of air which is condensed or rarefied in them according to the increase or the diminution of the substance of the muscles in which latter case the concavity i always has a larger curve than the muscle of undulating movements and equipoise in figures and other animals when representing a human figure or some graceful animal be careful to avoid a wooden stiffness that is to say make them move with equipoise and balance so as not to look like a piece of wood but those you want to represent as strong you must not make so excepting in the turn of the head how to pose figures of grace in the limbs the limbs should be adapted to the body with grace and with reference to the effect that you wish the figure to produce and if you wish to produce a figure that shall of itself look light and graceful you must make the limbs elegant and extended and without too much display of the muscles and those few that are needed for your purpose you must indicate softly that is not very prominent and without strong shadows the limbs and particularly the arms easy that is none of the limbs should be in a straight line with the adjoining parts and if the hips which are the pole of a man are by reason of his position placed so that the right is higher than the left make the point of the higher shoulder in a perpendicular line above the highest prominence of the hip and let this right shoulder be lower than the left let the pit of the throat always be over the centre of the joint of the foot on which the man is leaning the leg which is free should have the knee lower than the other and near the other leg the positions of the head and arms are endless and i shall therefore not enlarge on any rules for them still let them be easy and pleasing with various turns and twists and the joints gracefully bent that they may not look like pieces of wood of appropriate gestures a picture or representation of human figures ought to be done in such a way as that the spectator may easily recognise by means of their attitudes the purpose in their minds thus if you have to represent a man of noble character in the act of speaking let his gestures be such as naturally accompany good words and in the same way if you wish to depict a man of a brutal nature give him fierce movements as with his arms flung out towards the listener and his head and breast thrust forward beyond his feet as if following the speaker s hands thus it is with a deaf and dumb person who when he sees two men in conversation although he is deprived of hearing can nevertheless understand from the attitudes and gestures of the speakers the nature of their discussion i once saw in florence a man who had become deaf who when you spoke very loud did not understand you but if you spoke gently and without making any sound understood merely from the movement of the lips now perhaps you will say that the lips of a man who speaks loudly do not move like those of one speaking softly and that if they were to move them alike they would be alike understood as to this argument i leave the decision to experiment make a man speak to you gently and note the motion of his lips footnote the first ten lines of this text have already been published but with a slightly different reading by dr m jordan das malerbuch leonardo da vinci s p of representing a man speaking to a multitude when you wish to represent a man speaking to a number of people consider the matter of which he has to treat and adapt his action to the subject thus if he speaks persuasively let his action be appropriate to it if the matter in hand be to set forth an argument let the speaker with the fingers of the right hand hold one finger of the left hand having the two smaller ones closed and his face alert and turned towards the people with mouth a little open to look as though he spoke and if he is sitting let him appear as though about to rise with his head forward if you represent him standing make him leaning slightly forward with body and head towards the people these you must represent as silent and attentive all looking at the orator s face with gestures of admiration and make some old men in astonishment at the things they hear with the corners of their mouths pulled down and drawn in their cheeks full of furrows and their eyebrows raised and wrinkling the forehead where they meet again some sitting with their fingers clasped holding their weary knees again some bent old man with one knee crossed over the other on which let him hold his hand with his other elbow resting in it and the hand supporting his bearded chin footnote the sketches introduced here are a facsimile of a pen and ink drawing in the louvre which herr carl brun considers as studies for the last supper in the church of santa maria delle grazie see leonardo da vinci lxi pp and in dohme s kunst und kunstler leipzig seemann i shall not here enter into any discussion of this suggestion but as a justification for introducing the drawing in this place i may point out that some of the figures illustrate this passage as perfectly as though they had been drawn for that express purpose i have discussed the probability of a connection between this sketch and the picture of the last supper on p the original drawing is centimetres wide by high the drawing in silver point on reddish paper given on pl lii no the original at windsor castle may also serve to illustrate the subject of appropriate gestures treated in nos and of the disposition of limbs as regards the disposition of limbs in movement you will have to consider that when you wish to represent a man who by some chance has to turn backwards or to one side you must not make him move his feet and all his limbs towards the side to which he turns his head rather must you make the action proceed by degrees and through the different joints that is those of the foot the knee and the hip and the neck and if you set him on the right leg you must make the left knee bend inwards and let his foot be slightly raised on the outside and the left shoulder be somewhat lower than the right while the nape of the neck is in a line directly over the outer ancle of the left foot and the left shoulder will be in a perpendicular line above the toes of the right foot and always set your figures so that the side to which the head turns is not the side to which the breast faces since nature for our convenience has made us with a neck which bends with ease in many directions the eye wishing to turn to various points the different joints and if at any time you make a man sitting with his arms at work on something which is sideways to him make the upper part of his body turn upon the hips footnote compare pl vii no the original drawing at windsor castle is numbered when you draw the nude always sketch the whole figure and then finish those limbs which seem to you the best but make them act with the other limbs otherwise you will get a habit of never putting the limbs well together on the body never make the head turn the same way as the torso nor the arm and leg move together on the same side and if the face is turned to the right shoulder make all the parts lower on the left side than on the right and when you turn the body with the breast outwards if the head turns to the left side make the parts on the right side higher than those on the left footnote in the original ms a much defaced sketch is to be seen by the side of the second part of this chapter its faded condition has rendered reproduction impossible in m ravaisson s facsimile the outlines of the head have probably been touched up this passage however is fitly illustrated by the drawings on pl xxi of painting of the nature of movements in man do not repeat the same gestures in the limbs of men unless you are compelled by the necessity of their action as is shown in a b footnote see pl v where part of the text is also reproduced the effaced figure to the extreme left has evidently been cancelled by leonardo himself as unsatisfactory the motions of men must be such as suggest their dignity or their baseness of painting make your work carry out your purpose and meaning that is when you draw a figure consider well who it is and what you wish it to be doing of painting with regard to any action which you give in a picture to an old man or to a young one you must make it more energetic in the young man in proportion as he is stronger than the old one and in the same way with a young man and an infant of setting on the limbs the limbs which are used for labour must be muscular and those which are not much used you must make without muscles and softly rounded of the action of the figures represent your figures in such action as may be fitted to express what purpose is in the mind of each otherwise your art will not be admirable v suggestions for compositions of painting battle pieces of the way of representing a battle first you must represent the smoke of artillery mingling in the air with the dust and tossed up by the movement of horses and the combatants and this mixture you must express thus the dust being a thing of earth has weight and although from its fineness it is easily tossed up and mingles with the air it nevertheless readily falls again it is the finest part that rises highest hence that part will be least seen and will look almost of the same colour as the air the higher the smoke mixed with the dust laden air rises towards a certain level the more it will look like a dark cloud and it will be seen that at the top where the smoke is more separate from the dust the smoke will assume a bluish tinge and the dust will tend to its colour this mixture of air smoke and dust will look much lighter on the side whence the light comes than on the opposite side the more the combatants are in this turmoil the less will they be seen and the less contrast will there be in their lights and shadows their faces and figures and their appearance and the musketeers as well as those near them you must make of a glowing red and this glow will diminish in proportion as it is remote from its cause the figures which are between you and the light if they be at a distance will appear dark on a light background and the lower part of their legs near the ground will be least visible because there the dust is coarsest and densest and if you introduce horses galloping outside the crowd make the little clouds of dust distant from each other in proportion to the strides made by the horses and the clouds which are furthest removed from the horses should be least visible make them high and spreading and thin and the nearer ones will be more conspicuous and smaller and denser the air must be full of arrows in every direction some shooting upwards some falling some flying level the balls from the guns must have a train of smoke following their flight the figures in the foreground you must make with dust on the hair and eyebrows and on other flat places likely to retain it the conquerors you will make rushing onwards with their hair and other light things flying on the wind with their brows bent down footnote compare and with the opposite limbs thrust forward that is where a man puts forward the right foot the left arm must be advanced and if you make any one fallen you must show the place where he has slipped and been dragged along the dust into blood stained mire and in the half liquid earth arround show the print of the tramping of men and horses who have passed that way make also a horse dragging the dead body of his master and leaving behind him in the dust and mud the track where the body was dragged along you must make the conquered and beaten pale their brows raised and knit and the skin above their brows furrowed with pain the sides of the nose with wrinkles going in an arch from the nostrils to the eyes and make the nostrils drawn up which is the cause of the lines of which i speak and the lips arched upwards and discovering the upper teeth and the teeth apart as with crying out and lamentation and make some one shielding his terrified eyes with one hand the palm towards the enemy while the other rests on the ground to support his half raised body others represent shouting with their mouths open and running away you must scatter arms of all sorts among the feet of the combatants as broken shields lances broken swords and other such objects and you must make the dead partly or entirely covered with dust which is changed into crimson mire where it has mingled with the flowing blood whose colour shows it issuing in a sinuous stream from the corpse others must be represented in the agonies of death grinding their teeth rolling their eyes with their fists clenched against their bodies and their legs contorted some might be shown disarmed and beaten down by the enemy turning upon the foe with teeth and nails to take an inhuman and bitter revenge you might see some riderless horse rushing among the enemy with his mane flying in the wind and doing no little mischief with his heels some maimed warrior may be seen fallen to the earth covering himself with his shield while the enemy bending over him tries to deal him a deathstroke there again might be seen a number of men fallen in a heap over a dead horse you would see some of the victors leaving the fight and issuing from the crowd rubbing their eyes and cheeks with both hands to clean them of the dirt made by their watering eyes smarting from the dust and smoke the reserves may be seen standing hopeful but cautious with watchful eyes shading them with their hands and gazing through the dense and murky confusion attentive to the commands of their captain the captain himself his staff raised hurries towards these auxiliaries pointing to the spot where they are most needed and there may be a river into which horses are galloping churning up the water all round them into turbulent waves of foam and water tossed into the air and among the legs and bodies of the horses and there must not be a level spot that is not trampled with gore of lighting the lower parts of bodies close together as of men in battle as to men and horses represented in battle their different parts will be dark in proportion as they are nearer to the ground on which they stand and this is proved by the sides of wells which grow darker in proportion to their depth the reason of which is that the deepest part of the well sees and receives a smaller amount of the luminous atmosphere than any other part and the pavement if it be of the same colour as the legs of these said men and horses will always be more lighted and at a more direct angle than the said legs c of the way to represent a night scene that which is entirely bereft of light is all darkness given a night under these conditions and that you want to represent a night scene arrange that there shall be a great fire then the objects which are nearest to this fire will be most tinged with its colour for those objects which are nearest to a coloured light participate most in its nature as therefore you give the fire a red colour you must make all the objects illuminated by it ruddy while those which are farther from the fire are more tinted by the black hue of night the figures which are seen against the fire look dark in the glare of the firelight because that side of the objects which you see is tinged by the darkness of the night and not by the fire and those who stand at the side are half dark and half red while those who are visible beyond the edges of the flame will be fully lighted by the ruddy glow against a black background as to their gestures make those which are near it screen themselves with their hands and cloaks as a defence against the intense heat and with their faces turned away as if about to retire of those farther off represent several as raising their hands to screen their eyes hurt by the intolerable glare of depicting a tempest describe a wind on land and at sea describe a storm of rain how to represent a tempest if you wish to represent a tempest consider and arrange well its effects as seen when the wind blowing over the face of the sea and earth removes and carries with it such things as are not fixed to the general mass and to represent the storm accurately you must first show the clouds scattered and torn and flying with the wind accompanied by clouds of sand blown up from the sea shore and boughs and leaves swept along by the strength and fury of the blast and scattered with other light objects through the air trees and plants must be bent to the ground almost as if they would follow the course of the gale with their branches twisted out of their natural growth and their leaves tossed and turned about footnote see pl xl no of the men who are there some must have fallen to the ground and be entangled in their garments and hardly to be recognized for the dust while those who remain standing may be behind some tree with their arms round it that the wind may not tear them away others with their hands over their eyes for the dust bending to the ground with their clothes and hair streaming in the wind footnote see pl xxxiv the right hand lower sketch let the sea be rough and tempestuous and full of foam whirled among the lofty waves while the wind flings the lighter spray through the stormy air till it resembles a dense and swathing mist of the ships that are therein some should be shown with rent sails and the tatters fluttering through the air with ropes broken and masts split and fallen and the ship itself lying in the trough of the sea and wrecked by the fury of the waves with the men shrieking and clinging to the fragments of the vessel make the clouds driven by the impetuosity of the wind and flung against the lofty mountain tops and wreathed and torn like waves beating upon rocks the air itself terrible from the deep darkness caused by the dust and fog and heavy clouds of representing the deluge to represent the deluge the air was darkened by the heavy rain whose oblique descent driven aslant by the rush of the winds flew in drifts through the air not otherwise than as we see dust varied only by the straight lines of the heavy drops of falling water but it was tinged with the colour of the fire kindled by the thunder bolts by which the clouds were rent and shattered and whose flashes revealed the broad waters of the inundated valleys above which was seen the verdure of the bending tree tops neptune will be seen in the midst of the water with his trident and let aeolus with his winds be shown entangling the trees floating uprooted and whirling in the huge waves the horizon and the whole hemisphere were obscure but lurid from the flashes of the incessant lightning men and birds might be seen crowded on the tall trees which remained uncovered by the swelling waters originators of the mountains which surround the great abysses footnote compare vol ii no of the deluge and how to represent it in a picture let the dark and gloomy air be seen buffeted by the rush of contrary winds and dense from the continued rain mingled with hail and bearing hither and thither an infinite number of branches torn from the trees and mixed with numberless leaves all round may be seen venerable trees uprooted and stripped by the fury of the winds and fragments of mountains already scoured bare by the torrents falling into those torrents and choking their valleys till the swollen rivers overflow and submerge the wide lowlands and their inhabitants again you might have seen on many of the hill tops terrified animals of different kinds collected together and subdued to tameness in company with men and women who had fled there with their children the waters which covered the fields with their waves were in great part strewn with tables bedsteads boats and various other contrivances made from necessity and the fear of death on which were men and women with their children amid sounds of lamentation and weeping terrified by the fury of the winds which with their tempestuous violence rolled the waters under and over and about the bodies of the drowned nor was there any object lighter than the water which was not covered with a variety of animals which having come to a truce stood together in a frightened crowd among them wolves foxes snakes and others fleing from death and all the waters dashing on their shores seemed to be battling them with the blows of drowned bodies blows which killed those in whom any life remained you might have seen assemblages of men who with weapons in their hands defended the small spots that remained to them against lions wolves and beasts of prey who sought safety there ah what dreadful noises were heard in the air rent by the fury of the thunder and the lightnings it flashed forth which darted from the clouds dealing ruin and striking all that opposed its course ah how many you might have seen closing their ears with their hands to shut out the tremendous sounds made in the darkened air by the raging of the winds mingling with the rain the thunders of heaven and the fury of the thunder bolts others were not content with shutting their eyes but laid their hands one over the other to cover them the closer that they might not see the cruel slaughter of the human race by the wrath of god ah how many laments and how many in their terror flung themselves from the rocks huge branches of great oaks loaded with men were seen borne through the air by the impetuous fury of the winds how many were the boats upset some entire and some broken in pieces on the top of people labouring to escape with gestures and actions of grief foretelling a fearful death others with desperate act took their own lives hopeless of being able to endure such suffering and of these some flung themselves from lofty rocks others strangled themselves with their own hands other seized their own children and violently slew them at a blow some wounded and killed themselves with their own weapons others falling on their knees recommended themselves to god ah how many mothers wept over their drowned sons holding them upon their knees with arms raised spread out towards heaven and with words and various threatening gestures upbraiding the wrath of the gods others with clasped hands and fingers clenched gnawed them and devoured them till they bled crouching with their breast down on their knees in their intense and unbearable anguish herds of animals were to be seen such as horses oxen goats and swine already environed by the waters and left isolated on the high peaks of the mountains huddled together those in the middle climbing to the top and treading on the others and fighting fiercely themselves and many would die for lack of food already had the birds begun to settle on men and on other animals finding no land uncovered which was not occupied by living beings and already had famine the minister of death taken the lives of the greater number of the animals when the dead bodies now fermented where leaving the depth of the waters and were rising to the top among the buffeting waves where they were beating one against the other and like as balls full of air rebounded from the point of concussion these found a resting place on the bodies of the dead and above these judgements the air was seen covered with dark clouds riven by the forked flashes of the raging bolts of heaven lighting up on all sides the depth of the gloom the motion of the air is seen by the motion of the dust thrown up by the horse s running and this motion is as swift in again filling up the vacuum left in the air which enclosed the horse as he is rapid in passing away from the air perhaps it will seem to you that you may reproach me with having represented the currents made through the air by the motion of the wind notwithstanding that the wind itself is not visible in the air to this i must answer that it is not the motion of the wind but only the motion of the things carried along by it which is seen in the air the divisions footnote these observations added at the bottom of the page containing the full description of the doluge seem to indicate that it was leonardo s intention to elaborate the subject still farther in a separate treatise darkness wind tempest at sea floods of water forests on fire rain bolts from heaven earthquakes and ruins of mountains overthrow of cities

reproduced on these plates have however no connection with the sketches excepting the sketches of clouds on the right hand side these texts are given as no the group of small figures on pl xxxvii to the left seems to be intended for a congregatione d uomini see no description of the deluge let there be first represented the summit of a rugged mountain with valleys surrounding its base and on its sides let the surface of the soil be seen to slide together with the small roots of the bushes denuding great portions of the surrounding rocks and descending ruinous from these precipices in its boisterous course let it dash along and lay bare the twisted and gnarled roots of large trees overthrowing their roots upwards and let the mountains as they are scoured bare discover the profound fissures made in them by ancient earthquakes the base of the mountains may be in great part clothed and covered with ruins of shrubs hurled down from the sides of their lofty peaks which will be mixed with mud roots boughs of trees with all sorts of leaves thrust in with the mud and earth and stones and into the depth of some valley may have fallen the fragments of a mountain forming a shore to the swollen waters of its river which having already burst its banks will rush on in monstrous waves and the greatest will strike upon and destroy the walls of the cities and farmhouses in the valley then the ruins of the high buildings in these cities will throw up a great dust rising up in shape like smoke or wreathed clouds against the falling rain but the swollen waters will sweep round the pool which contains them striking in eddying whirlpools against the different obstacles and leaping into the air in muddy foam then falling back the beaten water will again be dashed into the air and the whirling waves which fly from the place of concussion and whose impetus moves them across other eddies going in a contrary direction after their recoil will be tossed up into the air but without dashing off from the surface where the water issues from the pool the spent waves will be seen spreading out towards the outlet and there falling or pouring through the air and gaining weight and impetus they will strike on the water below piercing it and rushing furiously to reach its depth from which being thrown back it returns to the surface of the lake carrying up the air that was submerged with it and this remains at the outlet in foam mingled with logs of wood and other matters lighter than water round these again are formed the beginnings of waves which increase the more in circumference as they acquire more movement and this movement rises less high in proportion as they acquire a broader base and thus they are less conspicuous as they die away but if these waves rebound from various objects they then return in direct opposition to the others following them observing the same law of increase in their curve as they have already acquired in the movement they started with the rain as it falls from the clouds is of the same colour as those clouds that is in its shaded side unless indeed the sun s rays should break through them in that case the rain will appear less dark than the clouds and if the heavy masses of ruin of large mountains or of other grand buildings fall into the vast pools of water a great quantity will be flung into the air and its movement will be in a contrary direction to that of the object which struck the water that is to say the angle of reflection will be equal to the angle of incidence of the objects carried down by the current those which are heaviest or rather largest in mass will keep farthest from the two opposite shores the water in the eddies revolves more swiftly in proportion as it is nearer to their centre the crests of the waves of the sea tumble to their bases falling with friction on the bubbles of their sides and this friction grinds the falling water into minute particles and this being converted into a dense mist mingles with the gale in the manner of curling smoke and wreathing clouds and at last it rises into the air and is converted into clouds but the rain which falls through the atmosphere being driven and tossed by the winds becomes rarer or denser according to the rarity or density of the winds that buffet it and thus there is generated in the atmosphere a moisture formed of the transparent particles of the rain which is near to the eye of the spectator the waves of the sea which break on the slope of the mountains which bound it will foam from the velocity with which they fall against these hills in rushing back they will meet the next wave as it comes and and after a loud noise return in a great flood to the sea whence they came let great numbers of inhabitants men and animals of all kinds be seen driven by the rising of the deluge to the peaks of the mountains in the midst of the waters aforesaid the wave of the sea at piombino is all foaming water footnote these two lines are written below the bottom sketch on pl xxxv the ms leic being written about the year or later it does not seem to me to follow that the sketches must have been made at piombino

up dust in the form of clouds but the colour of this dust will differ from that of the clouds where the rain is thickest let the colour of the dust be less conspicuous and where the dust is thickest let the rain be less conspicuous and where the rain is mingled with the wind and with the dust the clouds created by the rain must be more transparent than those of dust alone and when flames of fire are mingled with clouds of smoke and water very opaque and dark clouds will be formed footnote compare pl xl the drawing in indian ink on the left hand side which seems to be a reminiscence of his

various kinds of hastily made barks but little of the waves were visible in those places where the dark clouds and rain were reflected but where the flashes caused by the bolts of heaven were reflected there were seen as many bright spots caused by the image of the flashes as there were waves to reflect them to the eye of the spectator the number of the images produced by the flash of lightning on the waves of the water were multiplied in proportion to the distance of the spectator s eye so also the number of the images was diminished in proportion as they were nearer the eye which saw them footnote com e provato see vol ii nos and as it has been proved in the definition of the luminosity of the moon and of our marine horizon when the sun s rays are reflected in it and the eye

mustard seed and if you wish to make it with greater ease mix the ground seeds with linseed oil and put it all under the press to remove the smell of oil take the rank oil and put ten pints into a jar and make a mark on the jar at the height of the oil then add to it a pint of vinegar and make it boil till the oil has sunk to the level of the mark and thus you will be certain that the oil is returned to its original quantity and the vinegar will have gone off in vapour carrying with it the evil smell and i believe you may do the same with nut oil or any other oil that smells badly since walnuts are enveloped in a thin rind which partakes of the nature of if you do not remove it when you make the oil from them this skin tinges the oil and when you work with it this skin separates from the oil and rises to the surface of the painting and this is what makes it change to restore oil colours that have become dry if you want to restore oil colours that have become dry keep them soaking in soft soap for a night and with your finger mix them up with the soft soap then pour them into a cup and wash them with water and in this way you can restore colours that have got dry but take care that each colour has its own vessel to itself adding the colour by degrees as you restore it and mind that they are thoroughly softened and when you wish to use them for tempera wash them five and six times with spring water and leave them to settle if the soft soap should be thick with any of the colours pass it through a filter footnote the same remark applies to these sections as to no and oil mustard seed pounded with linseed oil outside the bowl fingers lower than the level of the oil and pass it into the neck of a bottle and let it stand and thus all the oil will separate from this milky liquid it will enter the bottle and be as clear as crystal and grind your colours with this and every coarse or viscid part will remain in the liquid you must know that all the oils that have been created in seads or fruits are quite clear by nature and the yellow colour you see in them only comes of your not knowing how to draw it out fire or heat by its nature has the power to make them acquire colour see for example the exudation or gums of trees which partake of the nature of rosin in a short time they harden because there is more heat in them than in oil and after some time they acquire a certain yellow hue tending to black but oil not having so much heat does not do so although it hardens to some extent into sediment it becomes finer the change in oil which occurs in painting proceeds from a certain fungus of the nature of a husk which exists in the skin which covers the nut and this being crushed along with the nuts and being of a nature much resembling oil mixes with it it is of so subtle a nature that it combines with all colours and then comes to the surface and this it is which makes them change and if you want the oil to be good and not to thicken put into it a little camphor melted over a slow fire and mix it well with the oil and it will never harden footnote the same remark applies to these sections as to no and on varnishes or powders varnish or powder take cypress oil and distil it and have a large pitcher and put in the extract with so much water as may make it appear like amber and cover it tightly so that none may evaporate and when it is dissolved you may add in your pitcher as much of the said solution as shall make it liquid to your taste and you must know that amber is the gum of the cypress tree varnish or powder and since varnish powder is the resin of juniper if you distil juniper you can dissolve the said varnish powder in the essence as explained above varnish or powder notch a juniper tree and give it water at the roots mix the liquor which exudes with nut oil and you will have a perfect varnish powder made like amber varnish powder fine and of the best quality make it in may or april varnish or powder mercury

put iris flowers into it and for red solanum berries salt may be made from human excrement burnt and calcined and made into lees and dried by a slow fire and all dung in like manner yields salt and these salts when distilled are very pungent sea water filtered through mud or clay leaves all its saltness in it woollen stuffs placed on board ship absorb fresh water if sea water is distilled under a retort it becomes of the first excellence and any one who has a little stove in his kitchen can with the same wood as he cooks with distil a great quantity of water if the retort is a large one mould the mould may be of venus or of jupiter and saturn and placed frequently in the fire and it should be worked with fine emery and the mould should be of venus and jupiter impasted over venus but first you will test venus and mercury mixed with jove and take means to cause mercury to disperse and then fold them well together so that venus or jupiter be connected as thinly as possible footnote

will set a hall in a blaze without injury do this first perfume the hall with a dense smoke of incense or some other odoriferous substance it is a good trick to play or boil ten pounds of brandy to evaporate but see that the hall is completely closed and throw up some powdered varnish among the fumes and this powder will be supported by the smoke then go into the room suddenly with a lighted torch and at once it will be in a blaze fire take away that yellow surface which covers oranges and distill them in an alembic until the distillation may be said to be perfect fire close a room tightly and have a brasier of brass or iron with fire in it and sprinkle on it two pints of aqua vitae a little at a time so that it may be converted into smoke then make some one come in with a light and suddenly you will see the room in a blaze like a flash of lightning and it will do no harm to any one vii philosophy and history of the art of painting the relation of art and nature what is fair in men passes away but not so in art he who despises painting loves neither philosophy nor nature if you condemn painting which is the only imitator of all visible works of nature you will certainly despise a subtle invention which brings philosophy and subtle speculation to the consideration of the nature of all forms seas and plains trees animals plants and flowers which are surrounded by shade and light and this is true knowledge and the legitimate issue of nature for painting is born of nature or to speak more correctly we will say it is the grandchild of nature for all visible things are produced by nature and these her children have given birth to painting hence we may justly call it the grandchild of nature and related to god painting is superior to poetry that painting surpasses all human works by the subtle considerations belonging to it the eye which is called the window of the soul is the principal means by which the central sense can most completely and abundantly appreciate the infinite works of nature and the ear is the second which acquires dignity by hearing of the things the eye has seen if you historians or poets or mathematicians had not seen things with your eyes you could not report of them in writing and if you poet tell a story with your pen the painter with his brush can tell it more easily with simpler completeness and less tedious to be understood and if you call painting dumb poetry the painter may call poetry blind painting now which is the worse defect to be blind or dumb though the poet is as free as the painter in the invention of his fictions they are not so satisfactory to men as paintings for though poetry is able to describe forms actions and places in words the painter deals with the actual similitude of the forms in order to represent them now tell me which is the nearer to the actual man the name of man or the image of the man the name of man differs in different countries but his form is never changed but by death and if the poet gratifies the sense by means of the ear the painter does so by the eye the worthier sense but i will say no more of this but that if a good painter represents the fury of a battle and if a poet describes one and they are both together put before the public you will see where most of the spectators will stop to which they will pay most attention on which they will bestow most praise and which will satisfy them best undoubtedly painting being by a long way the more intelligible and beautiful will please most write up the name of god christ in some spot and setup his image opposite and you will see which will be most reverenced painting comprehends in itself all the forms of nature while you have nothing but words which are not universal as form is and if you have the effects of the representation we have the representation of the effects take a poet who describes the beauty of a lady to her lover and a painter who represents her and you will see to which nature guides the enamoured critic certainly the proof should be allowed to rest on the verdict of experience you have ranked painting among the mechanical arts but in truth if painters were as apt at praising their own works in writing as you are it would not lie under the stigma of so base a name if you call it mechanical because it is in the first place manual and that it is the hand which produces what is to be found in the imagination you too writers who set down manually with the pen what is devised in your mind and if you say it is mechanical because it is done for money who falls into this error if error it can be called more than you if you lecture in the schools do you not go to whoever pays you most do you do any work without pay still i do not say this as blaming such views for every form of labour looks for its reward and if a poet should say i will invent a fiction with a great purpose the painter can do the same as apelles painted calumny if you were to say that poetry is more eternal i say the works of a coppersmith are more eternal still for time preserves them longer than your works or ours nevertheless they have not much imagination and a picture if painted on copper with enamel colours may be yet more permanent we by our arts may be called the grandsons of god if poetry deals with moral philosophy painting deals with natural philosophy poetry describes the action of the mind painting considers what the mind may effect by the motions of the body if poetry can terrify people by hideous fictions painting can do as much by depicting the same things in action supposing that a poet applies himself to represent beauty ferocity or a base a foul or a monstrous thing as against a painter he may in his ways bring forth a variety of forms but will the painter not satisfy more are there not pictures to be seen so like the actual things that they deceive men and animals painting is superior to sculpture that sculpture is less intellectual than painting and lacks many characteristics of nature i myself having exercised myself no less in sculpture than in painting and doing both one and the other in the same degree it seems to me that i can without invidiousness pronounce an opinion as to which of the two is of the greatest merit and difficulty and perfection in the first place sculpture requires a certain light that is from above a picture carries everywhere with it its own light and shade thus sculpture owes its importance to light and shade and the sculptor is aided in this by the nature of the relief which is inherent in it while the painter whose art expresses the accidental aspects of nature places his effects in the spots where nature must necessarily produce them the sculptor cannot diversify his work by the various natural colours of objects painting is not defective in any particular the sculptor when he uses perspective cannot make it in any way appear true that of the painter can appear like a hundred miles beyond the picture itself their works have no aerial perspective whatever they cannot represent transparent bodies they cannot represent luminous bodies nor reflected lights nor lustrous bodies as mirrors and the like polished surfaces nor mists nor dark skies nor an infinite number of things which need not be told for fear of tedium as regards the power of resisting time though they have this resistance footnote from what is here said as to painting on copper it is very evident that leonardo was not acquainted with the method of painting in oil on thin copper plates introduced by the flemish painters of the xviith century j lermolieff has already pointed out that in the various collections containing pictures by the great masters of the italian renaissance those painted on copper for instance the famous reading magdalen in the dresden gallery are the works of a much later date see zeitschrift fur bildende kunst vol x pg and werke italienischer master in den galerien von munchen dresden und berlin leipzig pg and compare no a picture painted on thick copper covered with white enamel on which it is painted with enamel colours and then put into the fire again and baked far exceeds sculpture in permanence it may be said that if a mistake is made it is not easy to remedy it it is but a poor argument to try to prove that a work be the nobler because oversights are irremediable i should rather say that it will be more difficult to improve the mind of the master who makes such mistakes than to repair the work he has spoilt we know very well that a really experienced and good painter will not make such mistakes on the contrary with sound rules he will remove so little at a time that he will bring his work to a good issue again the sculptor if working in clay or wax can add or reduce and when his model is finished it can easily be cast in bronze and this is the last operation and is the most permanent form of sculpture inasmuch as that which is merely of marble is liable to ruin but not bronze hence a painting done on copper which as i said of painting may be added to or altered resembles sculpture in bronze which having first been made in wax could then be altered or added to and if sculpture in bronze is durable this work in copper and enamel is absolutely imperishable bronze is but dark and rough after all but this latter is covered with various and lovely colours in infinite variety as has been said above or if you will have me only speak of painting on panel i am content to pronounce between it and sculpture saying that painting is the more beautiful and the more imaginative and the more copious while sculpture is the more durable but it has nothing else sculpture shows with little labour what in painting appears a miraculous thing to do to make what is impalpable appear palpable flat objects appear in relief distant objects seem close in fact painting is adorned with infinite possibilities which sculpture cannot command aphorisms of painting men and words are ready made and you o painter if you do not know how to make your figures move are like an orator who knows not how to use his words as soon as the poet ceases to represent in words what exists in nature he in fact ceases to resemble the painter for if the poet leaving such representation proceeds to describe the flowery and flattering speech of the figure which he wishes to make the speaker he then is an orator and no longer a poet nor a painter and if he speaks of the heavens he becomes an astrologer and philosopher and a theologian if he discourses of nature or god but if he restricts himself to the description of objects he would enter the lists against the painter if with words he could satisfy the eye as the painter does though you may be able to tell or write the exact description of forms the painter can so depict them that they will appear alive with the shadow and light which show the expression of a face which you cannot accomplish with the pen though it can be achieved by the brush on the history of painting that painting declines and deteriorates from age to age when painters have no other standard than painting already done hence the painter will produce pictures of small merit if he takes for his standard the pictures of others but if he will study from natural objects he will bear good fruit as was seen in the painters after the romans who always imitated each other and so their art constantly declined from age to age after these came giotto the florentine who not content with imitating the works of cimabue his master being born in the mountains and in a solitude inhabited only by goats and such beasts and being guided by nature to his art began by drawing on the rocks the movements of the goats of which he was keeper and thus he began to draw all the animals which were to be found in the country and in such wise that after much study he excelled not only all the masters of his time but all those of many bygone ages afterwards this art declined again because everyone imitated the pictures that were already done thus it went on from century to century until tomaso of florence nicknamed masaccio showed by his perfect works how those who take for their standard any one but nature the mistress of all masters weary themselves in vain and i would say about these mathematical studies that those who only study the authorities and not the works of nature are descendants but not sons of nature the mistress of all good authors oh how great is the folly of those who blame those who learn from nature footnote lasciando stare li autori in this observation we may detect an indirect evidence that leonardo regarded his knowledge of natural history as derived from his own investigations as well as his theories of perspective and optics compare what he says in praise of experience vol ii xix setting aside those authorities who themselves were the disciples of nature that the first drawing was a simple line drawn round the shadow of a man cast by the sun on a wall the painter s scope the painter strives and competes with nature x studies and sketches for pictures and decorations an artist s manuscript notes can hardly be expected to contain any thing more than incidental references to those masterpieces of his work of which the fame sounded in the writings of his contemporaries has left a glorious echo to posterity we need not therefore be surprised to find that the texts here reproduced do not afford us such comprehensive information as we could wish on the other hand the sketches and studies prepared by leonardo for the two grandest compositions he ever executed the fresco of the last supper in the refectory of santa maria delle grazie at milan and the cartoon of the battle of anghiari for the palazzo della signoria at florence have been preserved and though far from complete are so much more numerous than the manuscript notes that we are justified in asserting that in value and interest they amply compensate for the meagerness of the written suggestions the notes for the composition of the last supper which are given under nos and occur in a ms at south kensington ii written in the years this ms sketch was noted down not more than three or four years before the painting was executed which justifies the inference that at the time when it was written the painter had not made up his mind definitely even as to the general scheme of the work and from this we may also conclude that the drawings of apostles heads at windsor in red chalk must be ascribed to a later date they are studies for the head of st matthew the fourth figure on christ s left hand see pl xl vii the sketch in black chalk for the head of st philip the third figure on the left hand see pl xl viii for st peter s right arm see pl xlix and for the expressive head of judas which has unfortunately somewhat suffered by subsequent restoration of outlines see pl l according to a tradition as unfounded as it is improbable leonardo made use of the head of padre bandelli the prior of the convent as the prototype of his judas this however has already been contradicted by amoretti memorie storiche cap xiv the study of the head of a criminal on pl li has it seems to me a better claim to be regarded as one of the preparatory sketches for the head of judas the windsor collection contains two old copies of the head of st simon the figure to the extreme left of christ both of about equal merit they are marked as nos and the second was reproduced on pl viii of the grosvenor gallery publication in there is also at windsor a drawing in black chalk of folded hands marked with the old no no lxi of the grosvenor gallery publication which i believe to be a copy of the hands of st john by some unknown pupil a reproduction of the excellent drawings of heads of apostles in the possession of h r h the grand duchess of weimar would have been out of my province in this work and with regard to them i must confine myself to pointing out that the difference in style does not allow of our placing the weimar drawings in the same category as those here reproduced the mode of grouping in the weimar drawings is of itself sufficient to indicate that they were not executed before the picture was painted but on the contrary afterwards and it is on the face of it incredible that so great a master should thus have copied from his own work the drawing of christ s head in the brera palace at milan was perhaps originally the work of leonardo s hand it has unfortunately been entirely retouched and re drawn so that no decisive opinion can be formed as to its genuineness the red chalk drawing reproduced on pl xlvi is in the accademia at venice it was probably made before the text nos and was written the two pen and ink sketches on pl xlv seem to belong to an even earlier date the more finished drawing of the two on the right hand represents christ with only st john and judas and a third disciple whose action is precisely that described in no pl it is hardly necessary to observe that the other sketches on this page and the lines of text below the circle containing the solution of a geometrical problem have no reference to the picture of the last supper with this figure of christ may be compared a similar pen and ink drawing reproduced on page below on the left hand the original is in the louvre on this page again the rest of the sketches have no direct bearing on the composition of the last supper not even as it seems to me the group of four men at the bottom to the right hand who are listening to a fifth in their midst addressing them moreover the writing on this page an explanation of a disk shaped instrument is certainly not in the same style as we find constantly used by leonardo after the year it may be incidentally remarked that no sketches are known for the portrait of mona lisa nor do the ms notes ever allude to it though according to vasari the master had it in hand for fully four years leonardo s cartoon for the picture of the battle of anghiari has shared the fate of the rival work michaelangelo s bathers summoned to battle both have been lost in some wholly inexplicable manner i cannot here enter into the remarkable history of this work i can only give an account of what has been preserved to us of leonardo s scheme and preparations for executing it the extent of the material in studies and drawings was till now quite unknown their publication here may give some adequate idea of the grandeur of this famous work the text given as no contains a description of the particulars of the battle but for the reasons given in the note to this text i must abandon the idea of taking this passage as the basis of my attempt to reconstruct the picture as the artist conceived and executed it i may here remind the reader that leonardo prepared the cartoon in the sala del papa of santa maria novella at florence and worked there from the end of october till february and then was busied with the painting in the sala del consiglio in the palazzo della signoria till the work was interrupted at the end of may see milanesi s note to vasari pp vol iv ed vasari as is well known describes only one scene or episode of the cartoon the battle for the standard in the foreground of the composition as it would seem and this only was ever finished as a mural decoration in the sala del consiglio this portion of the composition is familiar to all from the disfigured copy engraved by edelinck mariette had already very acutely observed that edelinck must surely have worked from a flemish copy of the picture there is in the louvre a drawing by rubens no which also represents four horsemen fighting round a standard and which agrees with edelinck s engraving but the engraving reverses the drawing an earlier flemish drawing such as may have served as the model for both rubens and edelinck is in the uffizi collection see philpots s photograph no it seems to be a work of the second half of the xvith century a time when both the picture and the cartoon had already been destroyed it is apparently the production of a not very skilled hand raphael trichet du fresne mentions that a small picture by leonardo himself of the battle of the standard was then extant in the tuileries by this he probably means the painting on panel which is now in the possession of madame timbal in paris and which has lately been engraved by haussoullier as a work by leonardo the picture which is very carefully painted seems to me however to be the work of some unknown florentine painter and probably executed within the first ten years of the xvith century at the same time it would seem to be a copy not from leonardo s cartoon but from his picture in the palazzo della signoria at any rate this little picture and the small flemish drawing in florence are the oldest finished copies of this episode in the great composition of the battle of anghiari in his life of raphael vasari tells us that raphael copied certain works of leonardo s during his stay in florence raphael s first visit to florence lasted from the middle of october till july and he revisited it in the summer of the hasty sketch now in the possession of the university of oxford and reproduced on page also represents the battle of the standard and seems to have been made during his first stay and therefore not from the fresco but from the cartoon for on the same sheet we also find besides an old man s head drawn in leonardo s style some studies for the figure of st john the martyr which raphael used in in his great fresco in the church of san severo at perugia of leonardo s studies for the battle of anghiari i must in the first place point to five on three of which pl lii pl liii pl lvi we find studies for the episode of the standard the standard bearer who in the above named copies is seen stooping holding on to the staff across his shoulder is immediately recognisable as the left hand figure in raphael s sketch and we find it in a similar attitude in leonardo s pen and ink drawing in the british museum pl lii the lower figure to the right it is not difficult to identify the same figure in two more complicated groups in the pen and ink drawings now in the accademia at venice pl liii and pl liv where we also find some studies of foot soldiers fighting on the sheet in the british museum pl lii we find among others one group of three horses galloping forwards one horseman is thrown and protects himself with his buckler against the lance thrusts of two others on horseback who try to pierce him as they ride past the same action is repeated with some variation in two sketches in pen and ink on a third sheet in the accademia at venice pl lv a coincidence which suggests the probability of such an incident having actually been represented on the cartoon we are not it is true in a position to declare with any certainty which of these three dissimilar sketches may have been the nearest to the group finally adopted in executing the cartoon with regard however to one of the groups of horsemen it is possible to determine with perfect certainty not only which arrangement was preferred but the position it occupied in the composition the group of horsemen on pl lvii is a drawing in black chalk at windsor which is there attributed to leonardo but which appears to me to be the work of cesare da sesto and the commendatore giov morelli supports me in this view it can hardly be doubted that da sesto as a pupil of leonardo s made this drawing from his master s cartoon if we compare it with the copy made by raphael here reproduced for just above the fighting horseman in raphael s copy it is possible to detect a horse which is seen from behind going at a slower pace with his tail flying out to the right and the same horse may be seen in the very same attitude carrying a dimly sketched rider in the foreground of cesare da sesto s drawing if a very much rubbed drawing in black chalk at windsor pl lvi is as it appears to be the reversed impression of an original drawing it is not difficult to supplement from it the portions drawn by cesare da sesto nay it may prove possible to reconstruct the whole of the lost cartoon from the mass of materials we now have at hand which we may regard as the nucleus of the composition a large pen and ink drawing by raphael in the dresden collection representing three horsemen fighting and another by cesare da sesto in the uffizi of light horsemen fighting are a further contribution which will help us to reconstruct it the sketch reproduced on pl lv gives a suggestive example of the way in which foot soldiers may have been introduced into the cartoon as fighting among the groups of horsemen and i may here take the opportunity of mentioning that for reasons which it would be out of place to enlarge upon here i believe the two genuine drawings by raphael s hand in his venetian sketch book as it is called one of a standard bearer marching towards the left and one of two foot soldiers armed with spears and fighting with a horseman to be undoubtedly copies from the cartoon of the battle of anghiari leonardo s two drawings preserved in the museum at buda pesth and reproduced on pages and are preliminary studies for the heads of fighting warriors the two heads drawn in black chalk pg and the one seen in profile turned to the left drawn in red chalk pg correspond exactly with those of two horsemen in the scene of the fight round the standard as we see them in madame timbal s picture and in the other finished copies an old copy of the last named drawing by a pupil of leonardo is in ms c a b b see saggio tav xxii leonardo used to make such finished studies of heads as those drawn on detached sheets before beginning his pictures from his drawings compare the preparatory studies for the fresco of the last supper given on pl xlvii and pl l other drawings of heads all characterised by the expression of vehement excitement that is appropriate to men fighting are to be seen at windsor no and at the accademia at venice iv at the back of one of the drawings at buda pesth there is the bust of a warrior carrying a spear on his left shoulder holding up the left arm see csatakepek a xvi lk szazadbol osszeallitotta pvlszky karoly these drawings may have been made for other portions of the cartoon of which no copies exist and thus we are unable to identify these preparatory drawings finally i may add that a sketch of fighting horse and foot soldiers formerly in the possession of m thiers and published by charles blanc in his vies des peintres can hardly be accepted as genuine it is not to be found as i am informed among the late president s property and no one appears to know where it now is an attempted reconstruction of the cartoon which is not only unsuccessful but perfectly unfounded is to be seen in the lithograph by bergeret published in charles blanc s vies des peintres and reprinted in the great artists l da vinci p this misleading pasticcio may now be rejected without hesitation there are yet a few original drawings by leonardo which might be mentioned here as possibly belonging to the cartoon of the battle such as the pen and ink sketches on pl xxi and on pl xxxviii no but we should risk too wide a departure from the domain of ascertained fact with regard to the colours and other materials used by leonardo the reader may be referred to the quotations from the accounts for the picture in question given by milanesi in his edition of vasari vol iv p note where we find entries of a similar character to those in leonardo s note books for the year s k m see no that leonardo was employed in designing decorations and other preparations for high festivals particularly for the court of milan we learn not only from the writings of his contemporaries but from his own incidental allusions for instance in ms c l b l in the arrangement of the texts referring to this i have placed those first in which historical personages are named nos among the descriptions of allegorical subjects two texts lately found at oxford have been included nos and they are particularly interesting because they are accompanied by large sketches which render the meaning of the texts perfectly clear it is very intelligible that in other cases where there are no illustrative sketches the notes must necessarily remain obscure or admit of various interpretations the literature of the time affords ample evidence of the use of such allegorical representations particularly during the carnival and in leonardo s notes we find the carnival expressly mentioned nos and vasari in his life of pontormo particularly describes that artist s various undertakings for carnival festivities these very graphic descriptions appear to me to throw great light in more ways than one on the meaning of leonardo s various notes as to allegorical representations and also on mottoes and emblems nos in passing judgment on the allegorical sketches and emblems it must not be overlooked that even as pictures they were always accompanied by explanations in words several finished drawings of allegorical compositions or figures have been preserved but as they have no corresponding explanation in the mss they had no claim to be reproduced here the female figure on pl xxvi may perhaps be regarded as a study for such an allegorical painting of which the purport would have been explained by an inscription on madonna pictures in the autumn of i began the two madonna pictures footnote photographs of this page have been published by braun no and philpot no incominciai we have no other information as to the two pictures of the madonna here spoken of as leonardo here tells us that he had begun two madonnas at the same time the word incominciai may be understood to mean that he had begun at the same time preparatory studies for two pictures to be painted later if this is so the non existence of the pictures may be explained by supposing that they were only planned and never executed i may here mention a few studies for pictures of the madonna which probably belong to this early time particularly a drawing in silver point on bluish tinted paper at windsor see pl xl no a drawing of which the details have almost disappeared in the original but have been rendered quite distinct in the reproduction secondly a slight pen and ink sketch in the codex vallardi in the louvre fol no again a silver point drawing of a virgin and child drawn over again with the pen in the his de la salle collection also in the louvre no see vicomte both de tauzia notice des dessins de la collection his de la salle exposes au louvre paris pp this drawing is it is true traditionally ascribed to raphael but the author of the catalogue very justly points out its great resemblance with the sketches for madonnas in the british museum which are indisputably leonardo s some of these have been published by mr henry wallis in the art journal new ser no feb if the non existence of the two pictures here alluded to justifies my hypothesis that only studies for such pictures are meant by the text it may also be supposed that the drawings were made for some comrade in verrocchio s atelier see vasari sansoni s ed florence vol iv p e perche a lerenzo piaceva fuor di modo la maniera di lionardo la seppe cosi bene imitare che niuno fu che nella pulitezza e nel finir l opere con diligenza l imitasse pi di lui leonardo s notes give me no opportunity of discussing the pictures executed by him in florence before he moved to milan so the studies for the unfinished picture of the adoration of the magi in the uffizi florence cannot be described here nor would any discussion about the picture in the louvre la vierge aux rochers be appropriate in the absence of all allusion to it in the mss therefore when i presently add a few remarks on this painting in explanation of the master s drawings for it it will be not merely with a view to facilitate critical researches about the picture now in the national gallery london which by some critics has been pronounced to be a replica of the louvre picture but also because i take this opportunity of publishing several finished studies of the master s which even if they were not made in florence but later in milan must have been prior to the painting of the last supper the original picture in paris is at present so disfigured by dust and varnish that the current reproductions in photography actually give evidence more of the injuries to which the picture has been exposed than of the original work itself the wood cut given on p is only intended to give a general notion of the composition it must be understood that the outline and expression of the heads which in the picture is obscured but not destroyed is here altogether missed the facsimiles which follow are from drawings which appear to me to be studies for la vierge aux rochers a drawing in silver point on brown toned paper of a woman s head looking to the left in the royal library at turin apparently a study from nature for the angel s head pl xlii a study of drapery for the left leg of the same figure done with the brush indian ink on greenish paper the lights heightened with white the original is at windsor no the reproduction pl xliii is defective in the shadow on the upper part of the thigh which is not so deep as in the original it should also be observed that the folds of the drapery near the hips are somewhat altered in the finished work in the louvre while the london copy shows a greater resemblance to this study in that particular a study in red chalk for the bust of the infant christ no in the windsor collection pl xliv the well known silver point drawing on pale green paper in the louvre of a boy s head no in reiset notice des dessins ecoles d italie seems to me to be a slightly altered copy either from the original picture or from this red chalk study a silver point study on greenish paper for the head of john the baptist reproduced on p this was formerly in the codex vallardi and is now exhibited among the drawings in the louvre the lights are in the original heightened with white the outlines particularly round the head and ear are visibly restored there is a study of an outstretched hand no in the windsor collection which was published in the grosvenor gallery publication simply under the title of no study of a hand pointing which on the other hand i regard as a copy by a pupil the action occurs in the kneeling angel of the paris picture and not in the london copy these four genuine studies form i believe a valuable substitute in the absence of any ms notes referring to the celebrated paris picture bernardo di bandino s portrait a tan coloured small cap a doublet of black serge a black jerkin lined a blue coat lined with fur of foxes breasts and the collar of the jerkin covered with black and white stippled velvet bernardo di bandino baroncelli black hose footnote these eleven lines of text are by the side of the pen and ink drawing of a man hanged pl lxii no this drawing was exhibited in at the ecole des beaux arts in paris and the compilers of the catalogue amused themselves by giving the victim s name as follows un pendu vetu d une longue robe les mains li es sur le dos bernardo di bendino barontigni marchand de pantalons see catalogue descriptif des dessins de mailres anciens exposes a l ecole des beaux arts paris no pp now the criminal represented here is none other than bernardino di bandino baroncelli the murderer of giuliano de medici whose name as a coadjutor in the conspiracy of the pazzi has gained a melancholy notoriety by the tragedy of the th april bernardo was descended from an ancient family and the son of the man who under king ferrante was president of the high court of justice in naples his ruined fortunes it would seem induced him to join the pazzi he and francesco pazzi were entrusted with the task of murdering giuliano de medici on the fixed day their victim not appearing in the cathedral at the hour when they expected him the two conspirators ran to the palace of the medici and induced him to accompany them giuliano then took his place in the chancel of the cathedral and as the officiating priest raised the host the sign agreed upon bernardo stabbed the unsuspecting giuliano in the breast with a short sword giuliano stepped backwards and fell dead the attempt on lorenzo s life however by the other conspirators at the same moment failed of success bernardo no sooner saw that lorenzo tried to make his escape towards the sacristy than he rushed upon him and struck down francesco nori who endeavoured to protect lorenzo how lorenzo then took refuge behind the brazen doors of the sacristy and how as soon as giuliano s death was made known the further plans of the conspirators were defeated while a terrible vengeance overtook all the perpetrators and accomplices this is no place to tell bernardo bandini alone seemed to be favoured by fortune he hid first in the tower of the cathedral and then escaped undiscovered from florence poliziano who was with lorenzo in the cathedral says in his conjurationis pactianae commentarium bandinus fugitans in tiphernatem incidit a quo in aciem receptus senas pervenit and gino capponi in summing up the reports of the numerous contemporary narrators of the event says bernardo bandini ricoverato in costantinopoli fu per ordine del sultano preso e consegnato a un antonio di bernardino dei medici che lorenzo aveva mandato apposta in turchia cos era grande la potenza di quest uomo e grande la voglia di farne mostra e che non restasse in vita chi aveagli ucciso il fratello fu egli applicato appena giunto storia della republica di firenze ii details about the dates may be found in the chronichetta di belfredello strinati alfieri bernardo di bandino bandini sopradetto ne venne preso da gostantinopoti a d dicembre e disaminato che fu al bargello fu impiccato alle finestre di detto bargello allato alla doana a d dicembre mcccclxxix che pochi d stette it may however be mentioned with reference to the mode of writing the name of the assassin that though most of his contemporaries wrote bernardo bandini in the breve chronicon caroli petri de joanninis he is called bernardo di bandini baroncelli and in the sententiae domini matthaei de toscana bernardus joannis bandini de baroncellis as is written on leonardo s drawing of him when hanged now vasari in the life of andrea del castagno vol ii ed milanesi tells us that in this painter was commissioned by order of the signoria to represent the members of the pazzi conspiracy as traitors on the facade of the palazzo del podest the bargello this statement is obviously founded on a mistake for andrea del castagno was already dead in he had however been commissioned to paint rinaldo degli albizzi when declared a rebel and exiled in and his adherents as hanging head downwards and in consequence he had acquired the nickname of andrea degl impiccati on the st july the council of eight came to the following resolution item servatis etc deliberaverunt et santiaverunt sandro botticelli pro ejus labore in pingendo proditores flor quadraginta largos see g milanesi arch star vi p note as has been told giuliano de medici was murdered on the th april and we see by this that only three months later botticelli was paid for his painting of the proditores we can however hardly suppose that all the members of the conspiracy were depicted by him in fresco on the facade of the palace since no fewer than eighty had been condemned to death we have no means of knowing whether besides botticelli any other painters perhaps leonardo was commissioned when the criminals had been hanged in person out of the windows of the palazzo del podest to represent them there afterwards in effigy in memory of their disgrace nor do we know whether the assassin who had escaped may at first not have been provisionally represented as hanged in effigy now when we try to connect the historical facts with this drawing by leonardo reproduced on pl lxii no i and the full description of the conspirator s dress and its colour on the same sheet there seems to be no reasonable doubt that bernardo bandini is here represented as he was actually hanged on december th after his capture at constantinople the dress is certainly not that in which he committed the murder a long furred coat might very well be worn at constantinople or at florence in december but hardly in april the doubt remains whether leonardo described bernardo s dress so fully because it struck him as remarkable or whether we may not rather suppose that this sketch was actually made from nature with the intention of using it as a study for a wall painting to be executed it cannot be denied that the drawing has all the appearance of having been made for this purpose be this as it may the sketch under discussion proves at any rate that leonardo was in florence in december and the note that accompanies it is valuable as adding one more characteristic specimen to the very small number of his mss that can be proved to have been written between and notes on the last supper one who was drinking and has left the glass in its position and turned his head towards the speaker another twisting the fingers of his hands together turns with stern brows to his companion another with his hands spread open shows the palms and shrugs his shoulders up his ears making a mouth of astonishment another speaks into his neighbour s ear and he as he listens to him turns towards him to lend an ear while he holds a knife in one hand and in the other the loaf half cut through by the knife another who has turned holding a knife in his hand upsets with his hand a glass on the table footnote in the original ms there is no sketch to accompany these passages and if we compare them with those drawings made by leonardo in preparation for the composition of the picture pl xlv xlvi compare also pl lii and the drawings on p it is impossible to recognise in them a faithful interpretation of the whole of this text but if we compare these passages with the finished picture see p we shall see that in many places they coincide for instance compare no with the fourth figure on the right hand of christ the various actions described in lines are to be seen in the group of peter john and judas in the finished picture however it is not a glass but a salt cellar that judas is upsetting another lays his hand on the table and is looking another blows his mouthful another leans forward to see the speaker shading his eyes with his hand another draws back behind the one who leans forward and sees the speaker between the wall and the man who is leaning footnote chinato i have to express my regret for having misread this word written cinato in the original and having altered it to ciclo when i first published this text in the academy for nov immediately after i had discovered it and subsequently in the small biography of leonardo da vinci great artists p footnote in no line i must refer to the furthest figure on the left and describe actions which are given to the group of disciples on the left hand of christ christ count giovanni the one with the cardinal of mortaro footnote as this note is in the same small manuscript as the passage here immediately preceding it i may be justified in assuming that leonardo meant to use the features of the person here named as a suitable model for the figure of christ the celebrated drawing of the head of christ now hanging in the brera gallery at milan has obviously been so much restored that it is now impossible to say whether it was ever genuine we have only to compare it with the undoubtedly genuine drawings of heads of the disciples in pi xlvii xlviii and l to admit that not a single line of the milan drawing in its present state can be by the same hand philip simon matthew thomas james the greater peter philip andrew bartholomew footnote see pi xlvi the names of the disciples are given in the order in which they are written in the original from right to left above each head the original drawing is here slightly reduced in scale it measures centimetres in length by in breadth on the battle of anghiari florentine neri di gino capponi bernardetto de medici micheletto niccolo da pisa conte francesco pietro gian paolo guelfo orsino messer rinaldo degli albizzi begin with the address of niccolo piccinino to the soldiers and the banished florentines among whom are messer rinaldo degli albizzi and other florentines then let it be shown how he first mounted on horseback in armour and the whole army came after him squadrons of cavalry and foot soldiers went with him very early in the morning the patriarch went up a hill to reconnoitre the country that is the hills fields and the valley watered by a river and from thence he beheld niccolo picinino coming from borgo san sepolcro with his people and with a great dust and perceiving them he returned to the camp of his own people and addressed them having spoken he prayed to god with clasped hands when there appeared a cloud in which saint peter appeared and spoke to the patriarch cavalry were sent forward by the patriarch to hinder or check the rush of the enemy in the foremost troop francesco the son of niccolo piccinino was the first to attack the bridge which was held by the patriarch and the florentines beyond the bridge to his left he sent forward some infantry to engage ours who drove them back among whom was their captain micheletto whose lot it was to be that day at the head of the army here at this bridge there is a severe struggle our men conquer and the enemy is repulsed here guido and astorre his brother the lord of faenza with a great number of men re formed and renewed the fight and rushed upon the florentines with such force that they recovered the bridge and pushed forward as far as the tents but simonetto advanced with horse and fell upon the enemy and drove them back once more from the place and recaptured the bridge and behind him came more men with horse soldiers and thus for a long time they fought with varying fortune but then the patriarch in order to divert the enemy sent forward niccolo da pisa and napoleone orsino a beardless lad followed by a great multitude of men and then was done another great feat of arms at the same time niccolo piccinino urged forward the remnant of his men who once more made ours give way and if it had not been that the patriarch set himself at their head and by his words and deeds controlled the captains our soldiers would have taken to flight the patriarch had some artillery placed on the hill and with these he dispersed the enemy s infantry and the disorder was so complete that niccolo began to call back his son and all his men and they took to flight towards borgo and then began a great slaughter of men none escaped but the foremost of those who had fled or who hid themselves the battle continued until sunset when the patriarch gave his mind to recalling his men and burying the dead and afterwards a trophy was erected footnote this passage does not seem to me to be in leonardo s hand though it has hitherto been generally accepted as genuine not only is the writing unlike his but the spelling also is quite different i would suggest that this passage is a description of the events of the battle drawn up for the painter by order of the signoria perhaps by some historian commissioned by them to serve as a scheme or programme of the work the whole tenor of the style seems to me to argue in favour of this theory and besides it would be in no way surprising that such a document should have been preserved among leonardo s autographs allegorical representations referring to the duke of milan ermine with blood galeazzo between calm weather and a representation of a tempest footnote only the beginning of this text is legible the writing is much effaced and the sense is consequently obscure it seems to refer like the following passage to an allegorical picture il moro with spectacles and envy depicted with false report and justice black for il moro labour as having a branch of vine or a screw in her hand il moro as representing good fortune with hair and robes and his hands in front and messer gualtieri taking him by the robes with a respectful air from below having come in from the front again poverty in a hideous form running behind a youth il moro covers him with the skirt of his robe and with his gilt sceptre he threatens the monster a plant with its roots in the air to represent one who is at his last a robe and favour of tricks or of magpies and of burlesque poems or of starlings those who trust themselves to live near him and who will be a large crowd these shall all die cruel deaths and fathers and mothers together with their families will be devoured and killed by cruel creatures footnote have already been published by amoretti in memorie storiche cap xii he adds this note with regard to gualtieri a questo m gualtieri come ad uomo generoso e benefico scrive il bellincioni un sonetto pag per chiedergli un piacere e l tantio rendendo ragione a lodovico il moro perche pubblicasse le rime del bellincioni ci hammi imposto gli dice l humano fidele prudente e sollicito executore delli tuoi comandamenti gualtero che fa in tutte le cose ove tu possi far utile ogni studio vi metti a somewhat mysterious and evidently allegorical composition a pen and ink drawing at windsor see pl lviii contains a group of figures in which perhaps the idea is worked out which is spoken of in the text lines he was blacker than a hornet his eyes were as red as a burning fire and he rode on a tall horse six spans across and more than long with six giants tied up to his saddle bow and one in his hand which he gnawed with his teeth and behind him came boars with tusks sticking out of their mouths perhaps ten spans allegorical representations above the helmet place a half globe which is to signify our hemisphere in the form of a world on which let there be a peacock richly decorated and with his tail spread over the group and every ornament belonging to the horse should be of peacock s feathers on a gold ground to signify the beauty which comes of the grace bestowed on him who is a good servant on the shield a large mirror to signify that he who truly desires favour must be mirrored in his virtues on the opposite side will be represented fortitude in like manner in her place with her pillar in her hand robed in white to signify and all crowned and prudence with eyes the housing of the horse should be of plain cloth of gold closely sprinkled with peacock s eyes and this holds good for all the housings of the horse and the man s dress and the man s crest and his neck chain are of peacock s feathers on golden ground on the left side will be a wheel the centre of which should be attached to the centre of the horse s hinder thigh piece and in the centre prudence is seen robed in red charity sitting in a fiery chariot and with a branch of laurel in her hand to signify the hope which comes of good service messer antonio grimani of venice companion of antonio maria footnote messer antonio gri his name thus abbreviated is there can be no doubt grimani antonio grimani was the famous doge who in commanded the venetian fleet in battle against the turks but after the abortive conclusion of the expedition ludovico being the ally of the turks who took possession of friuli grimani was driven into exile he went to live at rome with his son cardinal domenico grimani on being recalled to venice he filled the office of doge from to antonio maria probably means antonio maria grimani the patriarch of aquileia fame should be depicted as covered all over with tongues instead of feathers and in the figure of a bird pleasure and pain represent as twins since there never is one without the other and as if they were united back to back since they are contrary to each other clay gold footnote oro fango gold clay these words stand below the allegorical figure if you take pleasure know that he has behind him one who will deal you tribulation and repentance this represents pleasure together with pain and show them as twins because one is never apart from the other they are back to back because they are opposed to each other and they exist as contraries in the same body because they have the same basis inasmuch as the origin of pleasure is labour and pain and the various forms of evil pleasure are the origin of pain therefore it is here represented with a reed in his right hand which is useless and without strength and the wounds it inflicts are poisoned in tuscany they are put to support beds to signify that it is here that vain dreams come and here a great part of life is consumed it is here that much precious time is wasted that is in the morning when the mind is composed and rested and the body is made fit to begin new labours there again many vain pleasures are enjoyed both by the mind in imagining impossible things and by the body in taking those pleasures that are often the cause of the failing of life and for these reasons the reed is held as their support footnote the pen and ink drawing on pi lix belongs to this passage footnote tribolatione in the drawing caltrops may be seen lying in the old man s right hand others are falling and others again are shewn on the ground similar caltrops are drawn in ms tri p and underneath them as well as on page the words triboli di ferro are written from the accompanying text it appears that they were intended to be scattered on the ground at the bottom of ditches to hinder the advance of the enemy count giulio porro who published a short account of the trivulzio ms in the archivio storico lombardo anno viii part iv dec has this note on the passages treating of triboli e qui aggiunger che anni sono quando venne fabbricata la nuova cavallerizza presso il castello di milano ne furono trovati due che io ho veduto ed erano precisamente quali si trovano descritti e disegnati da leonardo in questo codice there can therefore be no doubt that this means of defence was in general use whether it were originally leonardo s invention or not the play on the word tribolatione as it occurs in the drawing at oxford must then have been quite intelligible footnote these lines in the original are written on the left side of the page and refer to the figure shown on pi lxi next to it is placed the group of three figures given in pi lx no i lines and which are written under it are the only explanation given evil thinking is either envy or ingratitude envy must be represented with a contemptuous motion of the hand towards heaven because if she could she would use her strength against god make her with her face covered by a mask of fair seeming show her as wounded in the eye by a palm branch and by an olive branch and wounded in the ear by laurel and myrtle to signify that victory and truth are odious to her many thunderbolts should proceed from her to signify her evil speaking let her be lean and haggard because she is in perpetual torment make her heart gnawed by a swelling serpent and make her with a quiver with tongues serving as arrows because she often offends with it give her a leopard s skin because this creature kills the lion out of envy and by deceit give her too a vase in her hand full of flowers and scorpions and toads and other venomous creatures make her ride upon death because envy never dying never tires of ruling make her bridle and load her with divers kinds of arms because all her weapons are deadly toleration intolerable no sooner is virtue born than envy comes into the world to attack it and sooner will there be a body without a shadow than virtue without envy footnote the larger of

places and let to fall at festivals in open places at summer time end of volume the notebooks of leonardo da vinci volume translated by jean paul richter xi the notes on sculpture compared with the mass of manuscript treating of painting a very small number of passages bearing on the practice and methods of sculpture are to be found scattered through the note books these are here given at the beginning of this section nos there is less cause for surprise at finding that the equestrian statue of francesco sforza is only incidentally spoken of for although leonardo must have worked at it for a long succession of years it is not in the nature of the case that it could have given rise to much writing we may therefore regard it as particularly fortunate that no fewer than thirteen notes in the master s handwriting can be brought together which seem to throw light on the mysterious history of this famous work until now writers on leonardo were acquainted only with the passages numbered and in arranging these notes on sculpture i have given the precedence to those which treat of the casting of the monument not merely because they are the fullest but more especially with a view to reconstructing the monument an achievement which really almost lies within our reach by combining and comparing the whole of the materials now brought to light alike in notes and in sketches a good deal of the first two passages nos and which refer to this subject seems obscure and incomprehensible still they supplement each other and one contributes in no small degree to the comprehension of the other a very interesting and instructive commentary on these passages may be found in the fourth chapter of vasari s introduzione della scultura under the title come si fanno i modelli per fare di bronzo le figure grandi e picciole e come le forme per buttarle come si armino di ferri e come si gettino di metallo c among the drawings of models of the moulds for casting we find only one which seems to represent the horse in the act of galloping no all the other designs show the horse as pacing quietly and as these studies of the horse are accompanied by copious notes as to the method of casting the question as to the position of the horse in the model finally selected seems to be decided by preponderating evidence il cavallo dello sforza c boito remarks very appositely in the saggio on page doveva sembrare fratello al cavallo del colleoni e si direbbe che questo fosse figlio del cavallo del gattamelata il quale pare figlio di uno dei quattro cavalli che stavano forse sull arco di nerone in roma now at venice the publication of the saggio also contains the reproduction of a drawing in red chalk representing a horse walking to the left and supported by a scaffolding given here on pl lxxvi no it must remain uncertain whether this represents the model as it stood during the preparations for casting it or whether as seems to me highly improbable this sketch shows the model as it was exhibited in on the piazza del castello in milan under a triumphal arch on the occasion of the marriage of the emperor maximilian to bianca maria sforza the only important point here is to prove that strong evidence seems to show that of the numerous studies for the equestrian statue only those which represent the horse pacing agree with the schemes of the final plans the second group of preparatory sketches representing the horse as galloping must therefore be considered separately a distinction which in recapitulating the history of the origin of the monument seems justified by the note given under no galeazza maria sforza was assassinated in before his scheme for erecting a monument to his father francesco sforza could be carried into effect in the following year ludovico il moro the young aspirant to the throne was exiled to pisa and only returned to milan in when he was lord governatore of the state of milan in after the minister cecco simonetta had been murdered it may have been soon after this that ludovico il moro announced a competition for an equestrian statue and it is tolerably certain that antonio del pollajuolo took part in it from this passage in vasari s life of this artist e si trovo dopo la morte sua il disegno e modello che a lodovico sforza egli aveva fatto per la statua a cavallo di francesco sforza duca di milano il quale disegno e nel nostro libro in due modi in uno egli ha sotto verona nell altro egli tutto armato e sopra un basamento pieno di battaglie fa saltare il cavallo addosso a un armato ma la cagione perche non mettesse questi disegni in opera non ho gia potuto sapere one of pollajuolo s drawings as here described has lately been discovered by senatore giovanni morelli in the munich pinacothek here the profile of the horseman is a portrait of francesco duke of milan and under the horse who is galloping to the left we see a warrior thrown and lying on the ground precisely the same idea as we find in some of leonardo s designs for the monument as on pl lxvi lxvii lxviii lxix and lxxii no and as it is impossible to explain this remarkable coincidence by supposing that either artist borrowed it from the other we can only conclude that in the terms of the competition the subject proposed was the duke on a horse in full gallop with a fallen foe under its hoofs leonardo may have been in the competition there and then but the means for executing the monument do not seem to have been at once forthcoming it was not perhaps until some years later that leonardo in a letter to the duke no reminded him of the project for the monument then after he had obeyed a summons to milan the plan seems to have been so far modified perhaps in consequence of a remonstrance on the part of the artist that a pacing horse was substituted for one galloping and it may have been at the same time that the colossal dimensions of the statue were first decided on the designs given on pl lxx lxxi lxxii and lxxiii and lxxiv and on pp and as well as three sketches on pl lxix may be studied with reference to the project in its new form though it is hardly possible to believe that in either of these we see the design as it was actually carried out it is probable that in milan leonardo worked less on drawings than in making small models of wax and clay as preparatory to his larger model among the drawings enumerated above one in black chalk pl lxxiii the upper sketch on the right hand side reminds us strongly of the antique statue of marcus aurelius if as it would seem leonardo had not until then visited rome he might easily have known this statue from drawings by his former master and friend verrocchio for verrocchio had been in rome for a long time between and in pope sixtus iv had this antique equestrian statue restored and placed on a new pedestal in front of the church of san giovanni in luterano leonardo although he was painting independently as early as in is still spoken of as working in verrocchio s studio in two years later the venetian senate decided on erecting an equestrian statue to colleoni and as verrocchio to whom the work was entrusted did not at once move from florence to venice where he died in before the casting was completed but on the contrary remained in florence for some years perhaps even till leonardo probably had the opportunity of seeing all his designs for the equestrian statue at venice and the red chalk drawing on pl lxxiv may be a reminiscence of it the pen and ink drawing on pl lxxii no reminds us of donatello s statue of gattamelata at padua however it does not appear that leonardo was ever at padua before but we may conclude that he took a special interest in this early bronze statue and the reports he could procure of it form an incidental remark which is to be found in c a a a and which will be given in vol ii under ricordi or memoranda among the studies in the widest sense of the word made in preparation statue we may include the anatomy of the horse which lomazzo and vas mention the most important parts of this work still exist in the queen s li windsor it was beyond a doubt compiled by leonardo when at milan only interesting records to be found among these designs are reproduced in nos a but it must be pointed out that out of sheets of studies of the movements of the belonging to that treatise a horse in full gallop occurs but once if we may trust the account given by paulus jovius about l leonardo s horse was represented as vehementer incitatus et anhelatus jovius had probably seen the model exhibited at milan but need we in fact infer from this description that the horse was galloping compare vasari s description of the gattamelata monument at padua egli donatello vi ando ben volentieri e fece il cavallo di bronzo che e in sulla piazza di sant antonio nel quale si dimostra lo sbuffamento ed il fremito del cavallo ed il grande animo e la fierezza vivacissimamente espressa dall arte nella figura che lo cavalca these descriptions it seems to me would only serve to mark the difference between the work of the middle ages and that of the renaissance we learn from a statement of sabba da castiglione that when milan was taken by the french in the model sustained some injury and this informant who however is not invariably trustworthy adds that leonardo had devoted fully sixteen years to this work la forma del cavallo intorno a cui leonardo avea sedici anni continui consumati this often quoted passage has given ground for an assumption which has no other evidence to support it that leonardo had lived in milan ever since but i believe it is nearer the truth to suppose that this author s statement alludes to the fact that about sixteen years must have past since the competition in which leonardo had taken part i must in these remarks confine myself strictly to the task in hand and give no more of the history of the sforza monument than is needed to explain the texts and drawings i have been able to reproduce in the first place with regard to the drawings i may observe that they are all with the following two exceptions in the queen s library at windsor castle the red chalk drawing on pl lxxvi no is in the ms c a see no l and the fragmentary pen and ink drawing on page is in the ambrosian library the drawings from windsor on pl lxvi have undergone a trifling reduction from the size of the originals there can no longer be the slightest doubt that the well known engraving of several horsemen passavant le peintre graveur vol v p no is only a copy after original drawings by leonardo executed by some unknown engraver we have only to compare the engraving with the facsimiles of drawings on pl lxv no pl lxvii lxviii and lxix which it is quite evident have served as models for the engraver on pl lxv no in the larger sketch to the right hand only the base is distinctly visible the figure of the horseman is effaced leonardo evidently found it unsatisfactory and therefore rubbed it out the base of the monument the pedestal for the equestrian statue is repeatedly sketched on a magnificent plan in the sketch just mentioned it has the character of a shrine or aedicula to contain a sarcophagus captives in chains are here represented on the entablature with their backs turned to that portion of the monument which more strictly constitutes the pedestal of the horse the lower portion of the aedicula is surrounded by columns in the pen and ink drawing pl lxvi the lower drawing on the right hand side the sarcophagus is shown between the columns and above the entablature is a plinth on which the horse stands but this arrangement perhaps seemed to leonardo to lack solidity and in the little sketch on the left hand below the sarcophagus is shown as lying under an arched canopy in this the trophies and the captive warriors are detached from the angles in the first of these two sketches the place for the trophies is merely indicated by a few strokes in the third sketch on the left the base is altogether broader buttresses and pinnacles having been added so as to form three niches the black chalk drawing on pl lxviii shows a base in which the angles are formed by niches with pilasters in the little sketch to the extreme left on pl lxv no the equestrian statue serves to crown a circular temple somewhat resembling bramante s tempietto of san pietro in montario at rome while the sketch above to the right displays an arrangement faintly reminding us of the tomb of the scaligers in verona the base is thus constructed of two platforms or slabs the upper one considerably smaller than the lower one which is supported on flying buttresses with pinnacles on looking over the numerous studies in which the horse is not galloping but merely walking forward we find only one drawing for the pedestal and this to accord with the altered character of the statue is quieter and simpler in style pl lxxiv it rises almost vertically from the ground and is exactly as long as the pacing horse the whole base is here arranged either as an independent baldaquin or else as a projecting canopy over a recess in which the figure of the deceased duke is seen lying on his sarcophagus in the latter case it was probably intended as a tomb inside a church here too it was intended to fill the angles with trophies or captive warriors probably only no in the text refers to the work for the base of the monument if we compare the last mentioned sketch with the description of a plan for an equestrian monument to gian giacomo trivulzio no it seems by no means impossible that this drawing is a preparatory study for the very monument concerning which the manuscript gives us detailed information we have no historical record regarding this sketch nor do the archives in the trivulzio palace give us any information the simple monument to the great general in san nazaro maggiore in milan consists merely of a sarcophagus placed in recess high on the wall of an octagonal chapel the figure of the warrior is lying on the sarcophagus on which his name is inscribed a piece of sculpture which is certainly not leonardo s work gian giacomo trivulzio died at chartres in only five months before leonardo and it seems to me highly improbable that this should have been the date of this sketch under these circumstances it would have been done under the auspices of francis i but the italian general was certainly not in favour with the french monarch at the time gian giacomo trivulzio was a sworn foe to ludovico il moro whom he strove for years to overthrow on the th september he marched victorious into milan at the head of a french army in a short time however he was forced to quit milan again when ludovico il moro bore down upon the city with a force of swiss troops on the th of april following after defeating lodovico at novara trivulzio once more entered milan as a conqueror but his hopes of becoming governatore of the place were soon wrecked by intrigue this victory and triumph historians tell us were signalised by acts of vengeance against the dethroned sforza and it might have been particularly flattering to him that the casting and construction of the sforza monument were suspended for the time it must have been at this moment as it seems to me that he commissioned the artist to prepare designs for his own monument which he probably intended should find a place in the cathedral or in some other church he the husband of margherita di nicolino colleoni would have thought that he had a claim to the same distinction and public homage as his less illustrious connection had received at the hands of the venetian republic it was at this very time that trivulzio had a medal struck with a bust portrait of himself and the following remarkable inscription on the reverse deo favente dictvs ia expvlit lvdovicv sf sfortiam dvc ducem mli mediolani noie nomine regis francorvm eodem ann anno red t redit lvs ludovicus svperatvs et captvs est ab eo in the library of the palazzo trivulzio there is a ms of callimachus siculus written at the end of the xvth or beginning of the xvith century at the beginning of this ms there is an exquisite illuminated miniature of an equestrian statue with the name of the general on the base it is however very doubtful whether this has any connection with leonardo s design nos which treat of casting bronze have probably a very indirect bearing on the arrangements made for casting the equestrian statue of francesco sforza some portions evidently relate to the casting of cannon still in our researches about leonardo s work on the monument we may refer to them as giving us some clue to the process of bronze casting at that period some practical hints o of a statue if you wish to make a figure in marble first make one of clay and when you have finished it let it dry and place it in a case which should be large enough after the figure is taken out of it to receive also the marble from which you intend to reveal the figure in imitation of the one in clay after you have put the clay figure into this said case have little rods which will exactly slip in to the holes in it and thrust them so far in at each hole that each white rod may touch the figure in different parts of it and colour the portion of the rod that remains outside black and mark each rod and each hole with a countersign so that each may fit into its place then take the clay figure out of this case and put in your piece of marble taking off so much of the marble that all your rods may be hidden in the holes as far as their marks and to be the better able to do this make the case so that it can be lifted up but the bottom of it will always remain under the marble and in this way it can be lifted with tools with great ease some have erred in teaching sculptors to measure the limbs of their figures with threads as if they thought that these limbs were equally round in every part where these threads were wound about them measurement and division of a statue divide the head into degrees and each degree divide into points and each point into minutes and the minutes into minims and the minims into semi minims degree point minute minim sculptured figures which appear in motion will in their standing position actually look as if they were falling forward footnote figure di rilievo leonardo applies this term exclusively to wholly detached figures especially to those standing free this note apparently refers to some particular case though we have no knowledge of what that may have been if we suppose it to refer to the first model of the equestrian statue of francesco sforza see the introduction to the notes on sculpture this observation may be regarded as one of his arguments for abandoning the first scheme of the sforza monument in which the horse was to be galloping see page it is also in favour of this theory that the note is written in a manuscript volume already completed in leonardo s opinions as to the shortcomings of plastic works when compared with paintings are given under no and notes on the casting of the sforza monument three braces which bind the mould if you want to make simple casts quickly make them in a box of river sand wetted with vinegar when you shall have made the mould upon the horse you must make the thickness of the metal in clay observe in alloying how many hours are wanted for each hundredweight in casting each one keep the furnace and its fire well stopped up let the inside of all the moulds be wetted with linseed oil or oil of turpentine and then take a handful of powdered borax and greek pitch with aqua vitae and pitch the mould over outside so that being under ground the damp may not damage it to manage the large mould make a model of the small mould make a small room in proportion make the vents in the mould while it is on the horse hold the hoofs in the tongs and cast them with fish glue weigh the parts of the mould and the quantity of metal it will take to fill them and give so much to the furnace that it may afford to each part its amount of metal and this you may know by weighing the clay of each part of the mould to which the quantity in the furnace must correspond and this is done in order that the furnace for the legs when filled may not have to furnish metal from the legs to help out the head which would be impossible cast at the same casting as the horse the little door footnote the importance of the notes included under this number is not diminished by the fact that they have been lightly crossed out with red chalk possibly they were the first scheme for some fuller observations which no longer exist or perhaps they were crossed out when leonardo found himself obliged to give up the idea of casting the equestrian statue in the original the first two sketches are above l and the third below l the mould for the horse make the horse on legs of iron strong and well set on a good foundation then grease it and cover it with a coating leaving each coat to dry thoroughly layer by layer and this will thicken it by the breadth of three fingers now fix and bind it with iron as may be necessary moreover take off the mould and then make the thickness then fill the mould by degrees and make it good throughout encircle and bind it with its irons and bake it inside where it has to touch the bronze of making the mould in pieces draw upon the horse when finished all the pieces of the mould with which you wish to cover the horse and in laying on the clay cut it in every piece so that when the mould is finished you can take it off and then recompose it in its former position with its joins by the countersigns the square blocks a b will be between the cover and the core that is in the hollow where the melted bronze is to be and these square blocks of bronze will support the intervals between the mould and the cover at an equal distance and for this reason these squares are of great importance the clay should be mixed with sand take wax to return what is not used and to pay for what is used dry it in layers make the outside mould of plaster to save time in drying and the expense in wood and with this plaster enclose the irons props both outside and inside to a thickness of two fingers make terra cotta and this mould can be made in one day half a boat load of plaster will serve you good dam it up again with glue and clay or white of egg and bricks and rubbish footnote see pl lxxv the figure close to the sketch in the middle of the page between lines and has been added by a collector s hand in the original below line a square piece of the page has been cut out about centimetres by and a blank piece has been gummed

at a fire and all the excrements produce salt in a similar way and these salts when distilled are very strong footnote vasari repeatedly states in the fourth chapter of his introduzione della scultura

accepted as good and to secure the perfection of their rim it is requisite that in the first place all the coins should be a perfect circle and to do this a coin must before all be made perfect in weight and size and thickness therefore have several plates of metal made of the same size and thickness all drawn through the same gauge so as to come out in strips and out of these strips you will stamp the coins quite round as sieves are made for sorting chestnuts and these coins can then be stamped in the way indicated above c the hollow of the die must be uniformly wider than the lower but imperceptibly this cuts the coins perfectly round and of the exact thickness and weight and saves the man who cuts and weighs and the man who makes the coins round hence it passes only through the hands of the gauger and of the stamper and the coins are very superior footnote see pl lxxvi no the text of lines stands parallel farther evidence of leonardo s occupations and engagements at rome

times doubled and hit it sideways with the hammer when it will break up then mix it little by little and it can be founded with ease but if you hold it on the anvil you will never break it when it is large any one who grinds smalt should do it on plates of tempered steel with a cone shaped grinder then put it in aqua fortis which melts away the steel that may have been worked up and mixed with the smalt and which makes it black it then remains purified and clean and if you grind it on porphyry the porphyry will work up and mix with the smalt and spoil it and aqua fortis will never remove it

congealing often proceeds from too much fire or from ill dried wood to know the condition of the fire you may know when the fire is good and fit for your purpose by a clear flame and if you see the tips of the flames dull and ending in much smoke do not trust it and particularly when the flux metal is almost fluid of alloying the metal metal for guns must invariably be made with or even per cent that is of tin to one hundred of copper for the less you put in the stronger will the gun be when the tin should be added to the copper the tin should be put in with the copper when the copper is reduced to a fluid how to hasten the melting you can hasten the melting when ds of the copper is fluid you can then with a stick of chestnut wood repeatedly stir what of copper remains entire amidst what is melted introductory observations on the architectural designs xii and writings on architecture xiii until now very little has been known regarding leonardo s labours in the domain of architecture no building is known to have been planned and executed by him though by some contemporary writers incidental allusion is made to his occupying himself with architecture and his famous letter to lodovico il moro which has long been a well known document in which he offers his service as an architect to that prince tends to confirm the belief that he was something more than an amateur of the art this hypothesis has lately been confirmed by the publication of certain documents preserved at milan showing that leonardo was not only employed in preparing plans but that he took an active part with much credit as member of a commission on public buildings his name remains linked with the history of the building of the cathedral at pavia and that of the cathedral at milan leonardo s writings on architecture are dispersed among a large number of mss and it would be scarcely possible to master their contents without the opportunity of arranging sorting and comparing the whole mass of materials so as to have some comprehensive idea of the whole the sketches when isolated and considered by themselves might appear to be of but little value it is not till we understand their general purport from comparing them with each other that we can form any just estimate of their true worth leonardo seems to have had a project for writing a complete and separate treatise on architecture such as his predecessors and contemporaries had composed leon battista alberti filarete francesco di giorgio and perhaps also bramante but on the other hand it cannot be denied that possibly no such scheme was connected with the isolated notes and researches treating on special questions which are given in this work that he was merely working at problems in which for some reason or other he took a special interest a great number of important buildings were constructed in lombardy during the period between and and among them there are several by unknown architects of so high an artistic merit that it is certainly not improbable that either bramante or leonardo da vinci may have been directly or indirectly concerned in their erection having been engaged for now nearly twenty years in a thorough study of bramante s life and labours i have taken a particular interest in detecting the distinguishing marks of his style as compared with leonardo s in i made researches about the architectural drawings of the latter in the codex atlanticus at milan for the purpose of finding out if possible the original plans and sketches of the churches of santa maria delle grazie at milan and of the cathedral at pavia which buildings have been supposed to be the work both of bramante and of leonardo since i have repeatedly examined leonardo s architectural studies in the collection of his manuscripts in the institut de france and some of these i have already given to the public in my work on les projets primitifs pour la basilique de st pierre de rome p in i had the opportunity of examining the manuscript in the palazzo trivulzio at milan and in dr richter showed me in london the manuscripts in the possession of lord ashburnham and those in the british museum i have thus had opportunities of seeing most of leonardo s architectural drawings in the original but of the manuscripts tliemselves i have deciphered only the notes which accompany the sketches it is to dr richter s exertions that we owe the collected texts on architecture which are now published and while he has undertaken to be responsible for the correct reading of the original texts he has also made it his task to extract the whole of the materials from the various mss it has been my task to arrange and elucidate the texts under the heads which have been adopted in this work ms b at paris and the codex atlanticus at milan are the chief sources of our knowledge of leonardo as an architect and i have recently subjected these to a thorough re investigation expressly with a view to this work a complete reproduction of all leonardo s architectural sketches has not indeed been possible but as far as the necessarily restricted limits of the work have allowed the utmost completeness has been aimed at and no efforts have been spared to include every thing that can contribute to a knowledge of leonardo s style it would have been very interesting if it had been possible to give some general account at least of leonardo s work and studies in engineering fortification canal making and the like and it is only on mature reflection that we have reluctantly abandoned this idea leonardo s occupations in these departments have by no means so close a relation to literary work in the strict sense of the word as we are fairly justified in attributing to his numerous notes on architecture leonardo s architectural studies fall naturally under two heads i those drawings and sketches often accompanied by short remarks and explanations which may be regarded as designs for buildings or monuments intended to be built with these there are occasionally explanatory texts ii theoretical investigations and treatises a special interest attaches to these because they discuss a variety of questions which are of practical importance to this day leonardo s theory as to the origin and progress of cracks in buildings is perhaps to be considered as unique in its way in the literature of

milan footnote this passage was first published by amoretti in memorie storiche cap x una sua opera da riportarsi a quest anno fu il bagno fatto per la duchessa beatrice nel parco o giardino del castello lionardo non solo ne disegno il piccolo edifizio a foggia di padiglione nel cod segnato q dandone anche separatamente la pianta ma sotto vi scrisse padiglione del giardino della duchessa e sotto la pianta fondamento del padiglione ch e nel mezzo del labirinto del duca di milano nessuna data e presso il padiglione disegnato nella pagina ma poco sopra fra molti circoli intrecciati vedesi luglio e nella pagina presso ad alcuni disegni di legumi qualcheduno ha letto settembre in vece di come dovea scriverevi e probabilmente scrisse lionardo the original text however hardly bears the interpretation put upon it by amoretti he is mistaken as to the mark on the ms as well as in his statements as to the date for the ms in question has no date the date he gives occurs on the contrary in another note book finally it appears to me quite an open question whether leonardo was the architect who carried out the construction of the dome like pavilion here shown in section or of the ground plan of the pavilion drawn by the side of it must we in fact suppose that il duca di milano here mentioned was as has been generally assumed ludovico il moro he did not hold this title from the emperor before till that date he was only called governatore and leonardo in speaking of him mentions him generally as il moro even after on january he married beatrice d este the daughter of ercole i duke of ferrara she died on the nd january and for the reasons i have given it seems improbable that it should be this princess who is here spoken of as the duchessa di milano from the style of the handwriting it appears to me to be beyond all doubt that the ms b from which this passage is taken is older than the dated mss of and in that case the duke of milan here mentioned would be gian galeazzo and the duchess would be his wife isabella of aragon to whom he was married on the second february j p r the earth that is dug out from the cellars must be raised on one side so high as to make a terrace garden as high as the level of the hall but between the earth of the terrace and the wall of the house leave an interval in order that the damp may not spoil the principal walls iv ecclesiastical architecture a general observations a building should always be detached on all sides so that its form may be seen footnote the original text is reproduced on pl xcii no to the left hand at the bottom here there cannot and ought not to be any campanile on the contrary it must stand apart like that of the cathedral and of san giovanni at florence and of the cathedral at pisa where the campanile is quite detached as well as the dome thus each can display its own perfection if however you wish to join it to the church make the lantern serve for the campanile as in the church at chiaravalle footnote this text is written by the side of the plan given on pl xci no footnote the abbey of chiaravalle a few miles from milan has a central tower on the intersection of the cross in the style of that of the certosa of pavia but the style is mediaeval a d leonardo seems here to mean that in a building in which the circular form is strongly conspicuous the campanile must either be separated or rise from the centre of the building and therefore take the form of a lantern it never looks well to see the roofs of a church they should rather be flat and the water should run off by gutters made in the frieze footnote this text is to the left of the domed church reproduced on pl lxxxvii no b the theory of dome architecture this subject has been more extensively treated by leonardo in drawings than in writing still we may fairly assume that it was his purpose ultimately to embody the results of his investigation in a trattato delle cupole the amount of materials is remarkably extensive ms b is particularly rich in plans and elevations of churches with one or more domes from the simplest form to the most complicated that can be imagined considering the evident connexion between a great number of these sketches as well as the impossibility of seeing in them designs or preparatory sketches for any building intended to be erected the conclusion is obvious that they were not designed for any particular monument but were theoretical and ideal researches made in order to obtain a clear understanding of the laws which must govern the construction of a great central dome with smaller ones grouped round it and with or without the addition of spires so that each of these parts by itself and in its juxtaposition to the other parts should produce the grandest possible effect in these sketches leonardo seems to have exhausted every imaginable combination footnote in ms b b see pl c iii no we find eight geometrical patterns each drawn in a square and in ms c a fol to form a whole series of patterns done with the same intention the results of some of these problems are perhaps not quite satisfactory still they cannot be considered to give evidence of a want of taste or of any other defect in leonardo s architectural capacity they were no doubt intended exclusively for his own instruction and before all as it seems to illustrate the features or consequences resulting from a given principle i have already in another place footnote les projets primitifs pour la basilique de st pierre de rome par bramante raphael etc vol i p pointed out the law of construction for buildings crowned by a large dome namely that such a dome to produce the greatest effect possible should rise either from the centre of a greek cross or from the centre of a structure of which the plan has some symmetrical affinity to a circle this circle being at the same time the centre of the whole plan of the building leonardo s sketches show that he was fully aware as was to be expected of this truth few of them exhibit the form of a latin cross and when this is met with it generally gives evidence of the determination to assign as prominent a part as possible to the dome in the general effect of the building while it is evident on the one hand that the greater number of these domes had no particular purpose not being designed for execution on the other hand several reasons may be found for leonardo s perseverance in his studies of the subject besides the theoretical interest of the question for leonardo and his trattato and besides the taste for domes prevailing at that time it seems likely that the intended erection of some building of the first importance like the duomos of pavia and como the church of sta maria delle grazie at milan and the construction of a dome or central tower tiburio on the cathedral of milan may have stimulated leonardo to undertake a general and thorough investigation of the subject whilst leonardo s intercourse with bramante for ten years or more can hardly have remained without influence in this matter in fact now that some of this great architect s studies for s peter s at rome have at last become known he must be considered henceforth as the greatest master of dome architecture that ever existed his influence direct or indirect even on a genius like leonardo seems the more likely since leonardo s sketches reveal a style most similar to that of bramante whose name indeed occurs twice in leonardo s manuscript notes it must not be forgotten that leonardo was a florentine the characteristic form of the two principal domes of florence sta maria del fiore and the battisterio constantly appear as leading features in his sketches the church of san lorenzo at milan was at that time still intact the dome is to this day one of the most wonderful cupolas ever constructed and with its two smaller domes might well attract the attention and study of a never resting genius such as leonardo a whole class of these sketches betray in fact the direct influence of the church of s lorenzo and this also seems to have suggested the plan of bramante s dome of st peter s at rome in the following pages the various sketches for the construction of domes have been classified and discussed from a general point of view on two sheets pl lxxxiv c a b a and pl lxxxv nos ash ii b we see various dissimilar types grouped together thus these two sheets may be regarded as a sort of nomenclature of the different types on which we shall now have to treat churches formed on the plan of a greek cross group i domes rising from a circular base the simplest type of central building is a circular edifice pl lxxxiv no plan of a circular building surrounded by a colonnade pl lxxxiv no elevation of the former with a conical roof pl xc no a dodecagon as most nearly approaching the circle pl lxxxvi no four round chapels are added at the extremities of the two principal axes compare this plan with fig on p and fig on p w p b where the outer wall is octagonal group ii domes rising from a square base the plan is a square surrounded by a colonnade and the dome seems to be octagonal pl lxxxiv the square plan below the circular building no and its elevation to the left above the plan here the ground plan is square the upper storey octagonal a further development of this type is shown in two sketches c a a not reproduced here and in pl lxxxvi no which possibly belongs to no on pl lxxxiv pl lxxxv no and p fig a greek cross repeated p fig is another development of the square central plan the remainder of these studies show two different systems in the first the dome rises from a square plan in the second from an octagonal base group iii domes rising from a square base and four pillars footnote the ancient chapel san satiro via del falcone milan is a specimen of this type a first type a dome resting on four pillars in the centre of a square edifice with an apse in the middle of each of the four sides we have eleven variations of this type aa pl lxxxviii no bb pl lxxx no cc pl lxxxv nos dd pl lxxxiv no and beneath ee pl lxxxv nos b second type this consists in adding aisles to the whole plan of the first type columns are placed between the apses and the aisles the plan thus obtained is very nearly identical with that of s lorenzo at milan fig on p ms b a shows the result of this treatment adapted to a peculiar purpose about which we shall have to say a few words later on pl xcv no shows the same plan but with the addition of a short nave this plan seems to have been suggested by the general arrangement of s sepolcro at milan ms b b see the sketch reproduced on p by adding towers in the four outer angles to the last named plan we obtain a plan which bears the general features of bramante s plans for s peter s at rome footnote see les projets primitifs etc pl see p fig group iv domes rising from an octagonal base this system developed according to two different schemes has given rise to two classes with many varieties in a on each side of the octagon chapels of equal form are added in b the chapels are dissimilar those which terminate the principal axes being different in form from those which are added on the diagonal sides of the octagon a first class the chapel degli angeli at florence built only to a height of about feet by brunellesco may be considered as the prototype of this group and indeed it probably suggested it the fact that we see in ms b b pl xciv no by the side of brunellesco s plan for the basilica of sto spirito at florence a plan almost identical with that of the capella degli angeli confirms this supposition only two small differences or we may say improvements have been introduced by leonardo firstly the back of the chapels contains a third niche and each angle of the octagon a folded pilaster like those in bramante s sagrestia di s m presso san satiro at milan instead of an interval between the two pilasters as seen in the battistero at florence and in the sacristy of sto spirito in the same town and also in the above named chapel by brunellesco the first set of sketches which come under consideration have at first sight the appearance of mere geometrical studies they seem to have been suggested by the plan given on page fig ms b a in the centre of which is written santa maria in perticha da pavia at the place marked a on the reproduction a ms b b page fig in the middle of each side a column is added and in the axes of the intercolumnar spaces a second row of columns forms an aisle round the octagon these are placed at the intersection of a system of semicircles of which the sixteen columns on the sides of the octagon are the centres b the preceding diagram is completed and becomes more monumental in style in the sketch next to it ms b a see p fig an outer aisle is added by circles having for radius the distance between the columns in the middle sides of

customary antique style from two opposite sides steps ascend to the terrace in a single flight and beyond it to the temple above a large circular opening like that in the pantheon is in the dome above what may be the altar or perhaps the central monument on the level of the terrace below the section of a gallery given in the sketch to the right below shows the roof to be constructed on the principle of superimposed horizontal layers projecting one beyond the other and each furnished with a sort of heel which appears to be undercut so as to give the appearance of a beam from within granite alone would be adequate to the dimensions here given to the key stone as the thickness of the layers can hardly be considered to be less than a foot in taking this as the basis of our calculation for the dimensions of the whole construction the width of the chamber would be about feet but judging from the number of urns it contains and there is no reason to suppose that these urns were larger than usual it would seem to be no more than about or feet the construction of the vaults resembles those in the galleries of some etruscan tumuli for instance the regulini galeassi tomb at cervetri lately discovered and also that of the chamber and passages of the pyramid of cheops and of the treasury of atreus at mycenae the upper cone displays not only analogies with the monuments mentioned in the note but also with etruscan tumuli such as the cocumella tomb at vulci and the regulini galeassi tomb footnote see fersguson handbook of architecture i the whole scheme is one of the most magnificent in the history of architecture it would be difficult to decide as to whether any monument he had seen suggested this idea to leonardo but it is worth while to enquire if any monument or group of monuments of an earlier date may be supposed to have done so footnote there are in algiers two monuments commonly called le madracen and le tombeau de la chretienne which somewhat resemble

that church f the project for lifting up the battistero of florence and setting it on a basement among the very few details vasari gives as to the architectural studies of leonardo we read and among these models and designs there was one by way of which he showed several times to many ingenious citizens who then governed florence his readiness to lift up without ruining it the church of san giovanni in florence the battistero opposite the duomo in order to place under it the missing basement with steps he supported his assertions with reasons so persuasive that while he spoke the undertaking seemed feasable although every one of his hearers when he had departed could see by himself the impossibility of so vast an undertaking footnote this latter statement of vasari s must be

of the new platform in the perspective elevation the same edifice forming a polygon is shown as lifted up and resting on a circle of inverted arches which rest on an other circle of arches in the ordinary position but so placed that the inverted arches above rest on the spandrels of the lower range what seems to confirm the supposition that the lifting up of a building is here in question is the indication of engines for winding up such as jacks and a rack and wheel as the lifting apparatus represented on this sheet does not seem particularly applicable to an undertaking of such magnitude we may consider it to be a first sketch or scheme for the engines to be used g description of an unknown temple twelve flights of steps led up to the great temple which was eight hundred braccia in circumference and built on an octagonal plan at the eight corners were eight large plinths one braccia and a half high and three wide and six long at the bottom with an angle in the middle on these were eight great pillars standing on the plinths as a foundation and twenty four braccia high and on the top of these were eight capitals three braccia long and six wide above which were the architrave frieze and cornice four braccia and a half high and this was carried on in a straight line from one pillar to the next and so continuing for eight hundred braccia surrounded the whole temple from pillar to pillar to support this entablature there were ten large columns of the same height as the pillars three braccia thick above their bases which were one braccia and a half high the ascent to this temple was by twelve flights of steps and the temple was on the twelfth of an octagonal form and at each angle rose a large pillar and between the pillars were placed ten columns of the same height as the pillars rising at once from the pavement to a height of twenty eight braccia and a half and at this height the architrave frieze and cornice were placed which surrounded the temple having a length of eight hundred braccia at the same height and within the temple at the same level and all round the centre of the temple at a distance of braccia farther in are pillars corresponding to the eight pillars in the angles and columns corresponding to those placed in the outer spaces these rise to the same height as the former ones and over these the continuous architrave returns towards the outer row of pillars and columns footnote either this description is incomplete or as seems to me highly probable it refers to some ruin the enormous dimensions forbid our supposing this

see pl cx no the hasty sketch on the right hand side illustrates the unsatisfactory effect produced when the plinth is narrower than the wall the ancient architects beginning with the egyptians who as diodorus siculus writes were the first to build and construct large cities and castles public and private buildings of fine form large and well proportioned the column which has its thickness at the third part the one which would be thinnest in the middle would break the one which is of equal thickness and of equal strength is better for the edifice the second best as to the usefulness will be the one whose greatest thickness is where it joins with the base footnote see pl ciii no where the sketches belonging to lines are reproduced but reversed the sketch of columns here reproduced by a wood cut stands in the original close to lines the capital must be formed in this way divide its thickness at the top into at the foot make it and let it be high and you will have a square afterwards

the rest that is the ornaments to the taste of the sculptors but to return to the columns and in order to prove the reason of their strength or weakness according to their shape i say that when the lines starting from the summit of the column and ending at its base and their direction and length their distance apart or width may be equal i say that this column the cylinder of a body columnar in shape and its two opposite ends are two circles enclosed between parallel lines and through the centre of the cylinder is a straight line ending at the centre of these circles and called by the

branches the walls between the columns seem to be formed out of blocks of wood the pedestals are ornamented with a reticulated pattern from all this we may suppose that leonardo here had in mind either some festive decoration or perhaps a pavilion for some hunting place or park the sketch of columns marked gives an example of columns shaped like candelabra a form often employed at that time particularly in milan and the surrounding districts for instance in the cortile di casa castiglione now silvestre in the cathedral of como at porta della rana c concerning architraves of one or

the theory of architecture have come down to us only in a fragmentary state still there seems to be no doubt that he himself did not complete them it would seem that leonardo entertained the idea of writing a large and connected book on architecture and it is quite evident that the materials we possess which can be proved to have been written at different periods were noted down with a more or less definite aim and purpose they might all be collected under the one title studies on the strength of materials among them the investigations on the subject of fissures in walls are particularly thorough and very fully reported these passages are also especially interesting because leonardo was certainly the first writer on architecture who ever treated the subject at all here as in all other cases leonardo carefully avoids all abstract argument his data are not derived from the principles of algebra but from the laws of mechanics and his method throughout is strictly experimental though the conclusions drawn from his investigations may not have that precision which we are accustomed to find in leonardo s scientific labours their interest is not lessened they prove at any rate his deep sagacity and wonderfully clear mind no one perhaps who has studied these questions since leonardo has combined with a scientific mind anything like the artistic delicacy of perception which gives interest and lucidity to his observations i do not assert that the arrangement here adopted for the passages in question is that originally intended by leonardo but their distribution into five groups was suggested by the titles or headings which leonardo himself prefixed to most of these notes some of the longer sections perhaps should not to be in strict agreement with this division have been reproduced in their entirety in the place where they occur but the comparatively small amount of the materials we possess will render them even so sufficiently intelligible to the reader it did not therefore seem necessary or desirable to subdivide the passages merely for the sake of strict classification the small number of chapters given under the fifth class treating on the centre of gravity in roof beams bears no proportion to the number of drawings and studies which refer to the same subject only a small selection of these are reproduced in this work since the majority have no explanatory text i on fissures in walls first write the treatise on the causes of the giving way of walls and then separately treat of the remedies parallel fissures constantly occur in buildings which are erected on a hill side when the hill is composed of stratified rocks with an oblique stratification because water and other moisture often penetrates these oblique seams carrying in greasy and slippery soil and as the strata are not continuous down to the bottom of the valley the rocks slide in the direction of the slope and the motion does not cease till they have reached the bottom of the valley carrying with them as though in a boat that portion of the building which is separated by them from the rest the remedy for this is always to build thick piers under the wall which is slipping with arches from one to another and with a good scarp and let the piers have a firm foundation in the strata so that they may not break away from them in order to find the solid part of these strata it is necessary to make a shaft at the foot of the wall of great depth through the strata and in this shaft on the side from which the hill slopes smooth and flatten a space one palm wide from the top to the bottom and after some time this smooth portion made on the side of the shaft will show plainly which part of the hill is moving footnote see pl civ the cracks in walls will never be parallel unless the part of the wall that separates from the remainder does not slip down what is the law by which buildings have stability the stability of buildings is the result of the contrary law to the two former cases that is to say that the walls must be all built up equally and by degrees to equal heights all round the building and the whole thickness at once whatever kind of walls they may be and although a thin wall dries more quickly than a thick one it will not necessarily give way under the added weight day by day and thus although a thin wall dries more quickly than a thick one it will not give way under the weight which the latter may acquire from day to day because if double the amount of it dries in one day one of double the thickness will dry in two days or thereabouts thus the small addition of weight will be balanced by the smaller difference of time the adversary says that a which projects slips down and here the adversary says that r slips and not c how to prognosticate the causes of cracks in any sort of wall the part of the wall which does not slip is that in which the obliquity projects and overhangs the portion which has parted from it and slipped down on the situation of foundations and in what places they are a cause of ruin when the crevice in the wall is wider at the top than at the bottom it is a manifest sign that the cause of the fissure in the wall is remote from the perpendicular line through the crevice footnote lines refer to pl cv no line alle due anteciedete see on the same page lines the translation of this is doubtful and the meaning in any case very obscure lines are on the right hand margin close to the two sketches on pl cii no of cracks in walls which are wide at the bottom and narrow at the top and of their causes that wall which does not dry uniformly in an equal time always cracks a wall though of equal thickness will not dry with equal quickness if it is not everywhere in contact with the same medium thus if one side of a wall were in contact with a damp slope and the other were in contact with the air then this latter side would remain of the same size as before that side which dries in the air will shrink or diminish and the side which is kept damp will not dry and the dry portion will break away readily from the damp portion because the damp part not shrinking in the same proportion does not cohere and follow the movement of the part which dries continuously of arched cracks wide at the top and narrow below arched cracks wide at the top and narrow below are found in walled up doors which shrink more in their height than in their breadth and in proportion as their height is greater than their width and as the joints of the mortar are more numerous in the height than in the width the crack diminishes less in r o than in m n in proportion as there is less material between r and o than between n and m any crack made in a concave wall is wide below and narrow at the top and this originates as is here shown at b c d in the side figure that which gets wet increases in proportion to the moisture it imbibes and a wet object shrinks while drying in proportion to the amount of moisture which evaporates from it footnote the text of this passage is reproduced in facsimile on pl cvi to the left l are written inside the sketch no l are partly written over the sketch no to which they refer of the causes of fissures in the walls of public and private buildings the walls give way in cracks some of which are more or less vertical and others are oblique the cracks which are in a vertical direction are caused by the joining of new walls with old walls whether straight or with indentations fitting on to those of the old wall for as these indentations cannot bear the too great weight of the wall added on to them it is inevitable that they should break and give way to the settling of the new wall which will shrink one braccia in every ten more or less according to the greater or smaller quantity of mortar used between the stones of the masonry and whether this mortar is more or less liquid and observe that the walls should always be built first and then faced with the stones intended to face them for if you do not proceed thus since the wall settles more than the stone facing the projections left on the sides of the wall must inevitably give way because the stones used for facing the wall being larger than those over which they are laid they will necessarily have less mortar laid between the joints and consequently they settle less and this cannot happen if the facing is added after the wall is dry a b the new wall c the old wall which has already settled and the part a b settles afterwards although a being founded on c the old wall cannot possibly break having a stable foundation on the old wall but only the remainder b of the new wall will break away because it is built from top to bottom of the building and the remainder of the new wall will overhang the gap above the wall that has sunk a new tower founded partly on old masonry of stones which disjoin themselves from their mortar stones laid in regular courses from bottom to top and built up with an equal quantity of mortar settle equally throughout when the moisture that made the mortar soft evaporates by what is said above it is proved that the small extent of the new wall between a and n will settle but little in proportion to the extent of the same wall between c and d the proportion will in fact be that of the thinness of the mortar in relation to the number of courses or to the quantity of mortar laid between the stones above the different levels of the old wall footnote see pl cv no the top of the tower is wanting in this reproduction and with it the letter n which in the original stands above the letter a over the top of the tower while c stands perpendicularly over d this wall will break under the arch e f because the seven whole square bricks are not sufficient to sustain the spring of the arch placed on them and these seven bricks will give way in their middle exactly as appears in a b the reason is that the brick a has above it only the weight a k whilst the last brick under the arch has above it the weight c d x a c d seems to press on the arch towards the abutment at the point p but the weight p o opposes resistence to it whence the whole pressure is transmitted to the root of the arch therefore the foot of the arch acts like which is more than double of x z ii on fissures in niches on fissures in niches an arch constructed on a semicircle and bearing weights on the two opposite thirds of its curve will give way at five points of the curve to prove this let the weights be at n m which will break the arch a b f i say that by the foregoing as the extremities c and a are equally pressed upon by the thrust n it follows by the th that the arch will give way at the point which is furthest from the two forces acting on them and that is the middle e the same is to be understood of the opposite curve d g b hence the weights n m must sink but they cannot sink by the th without coming closer together and they cannot come together unless the extremities of the arch between them come closer and if these draw together the crown of the arch must break and thus the arch will give way in two places as was at first said c i ask given a weight at a what counteracts it in the direction n f and by what weight must the weight at f be counteracted on the shrinking of damp bodies of different thickness and width the window a is the cause of the crack at b and this crack is increased by the pressure of n and m which sink or penetrate into the soil in which foundations are built more than the lighter portion at b besides the old foundation under b has already settled and this the piers n and m have not yet done hence the part b does not settle down perpendicularly on the contrary it is thrown outwards obliquely and it cannot on the contrary be thrown inwards because a portion like this separated from the main wall is larger outside than inside and the main wall where it is broken is of the same shape and is also larger outside than inside therefore if this separate portion were to fall inwards the larger would have to pass through the smaller which is impossible hence it is evident that the portion of the semicircular wall when disunited from the main wall will be thrust outwards and not inwards as the adversary says when a dome or a half dome is crushed from above by an excess of weight the vault will give way forming a crack which diminishes towards the top and is wide below narrow on the inner side and wide outside as is the case with the outer husk of a pomegranate divided into many parts lengthwise for the more it is pressed in the direction of its length that part of the joints will open most which is most distant from the cause of the pressure and for that reason the arches of the vaults of any apse should never be more loaded than the arches of the principal building because that which weighs most presses most on the parts below and they sink into the foundations but this cannot happen to lighter structures like the said apses footnote the figure on pl cv no belongs to the first paragraph of this passage lines fig is sketched by the side of lines l and following the sketch below of a pomegranate refers to line the drawing fig is in the original over line and fig over line which of these two cubes will shrink the more uniformly the cube a resting on the pavement or the cube b suspended in the air when both cubes are equal in weight and bulk and of clay mixed with equal quantities of water the cube placed on the pavement diminishes more in height than in breadth which the cube above hanging in the air cannot do thus it is proved the cube shown above is better shown here below the final result of the two cylinders of damp clay that is a and b will be the pyramidal figures below c and d this is proved thus the cylinder a resting on block of stone being made of clay mixed with a great deal of water will sink by its weight which presses on its base and in proportion as it settles and spreads all the parts will be somewhat nearer to the base because that is charged with the whole weight iii on the nature of the arch what is an arch the arch is nothing else than a force originated by two weaknesses for the arch in buildings is composed of two segments of a circle each of which being very weak in itself tends to fall but as each opposes this tendency in the other the two weaknesses combine to form one strength of the kind of pressure in arches as the arch is a composite force it remains in equilibrium because the thrust is equal from both sides and if one of the segments weighs more than the other the stability is lost because the greater pressure will outweigh the lesser of distributing the pressure above an arch next to giving the segments of the circle equal weight it is necessary to load them equally or you will fall into the same defect as before where an arch breaks an arch breaks at the part which lies below half way from the centre second rupture of the arch if the excess of weight be placed in the middle of the arch at the point a that weight tends to fall towards b and the arch breaks at of its height at c e and g e is as many times stronger than e a as m o goes into m n on another cause of ruin the arch will likewise give way under a transversal thrust for when the charge is not thrown directly on the foot of the arch the arch lasts but a short time on the strength of the arch the way to give stability to the arch is to fill the spandrils with good masonry up to the level of its summit on the loading of round arches on the proper manner of loading the pointed arch on the evil effects of loading the pointed arch directly above its crown on the damage done to the pointed arch by throwing the pressure on the flanks an arch of small curve is safe in itself but if it be heavily charged it is necessary to strengthen the flanks well an arch of a very large curve is weak in itself and stronger if it be charged and will do little harm to its abutments and its places of giving way are o p footnote inside the large figure on the righi is the note da pesare la forza dell archo on the remedy for earthquakes the arch which throws its pressure perpendicularly on the abutments will fulfil its function whatever be its direction upside down sideways or upright the arch will not break if the chord of the outer arch does not touch the inner arch this is manifest by experience because whenever the chord a o n of the outer arch n r a approaches the inner arch x b y the arch will be weak and it will be weaker in proportion as the inner arch passes beyond that chord when an arch is loaded only on one side the thrust will press on the top of the other side and be transmitted to the spring of the arch on that side and it will break at a point half way between its two extremes where it is farthest from the chord a continuous body which has been forcibly bent into an arch thrusts in the direction of the straight line which it tends to recover in an arch judiciously weighted the thrust is oblique so that the triangle c n b has no weight upon it i here ask what weight will be needed to counterpoise and resist the tendency of each of these arches to give way footnote the two lower sketches are taken from the ms s k m iii a they have there no explanatory text on the strength of the arch in architecture the stability of the arch built by an architect resides in the tie and in the flanks on the position of the tie in the above named arch the position of the tie is of the same importance at the beginning of the arch and at the top of the perpendicular pier on which it rests this is proved by the nd of supports which says that part of a support has least resistance which is farthest from its solid attachment hence as the top of the pier is farthest from the middle of its true foundation and the same being the case at the opposite extremities of the arch which are the points farthest from the middle which is really its upper attachment we have concluded that the tie a b requires to be in such a position as that its opposite ends are between the four above mentioned extremes the adversary says that this arch must be more than half a circle and that then it will not need a tie because then the ends will not thrust outwards but inwards as is seen in the excess at a c b d to this it must be answered that this would be a very poor device for three reasons the first refers to the strength of the arch since it is proved that the circular parallel being composed of two semicircles will only break where these semicircles cross each other as is seen in the figure n m besides this it follows that there is a wider space between the extremes of the semicircle than between the plane of the walls the third reason is that the weight placed to counterbalance the strength of the arch diminishes in proportion as the piers of the arch are wider than the space between the piers fourthly in proportion as the parts at c a b d turn outwards the piers are weaker to support the arch above them the th is that all the material and weight of the arch which are in excess of the semicircle are useless and indeed mischievous and here it is to be noted that the weight placed above the arch will be more likely to break the arch at a b where the curve of the excess begins that is added to the semicircle than if the pier were straight up to its junction with the semicircle spring of the arch an arch loaded over the crown will give way at the left hand and right hand quarters this is proved by the th of this which says the opposite ends of the support are equally pressed upon by the weight suspended to them hence the weight shown at f is felt at b c that is half at each extremity and by the third which says in a support of equal strength throughout that portion will give way soonest which is farthest from its attachment whence it follows that d being equally distant from f e if the centering of the arch does not settle as the arch settles the mortar as it dries will shrink and detach itself from the bricks between which it was laid to keep them together and as it thus leaves them disjoined the vault will remain loosely built and the rains will soon destroy it on the strength and nature of arches and where they are strong or weak and the same as to columns that part of the arch which is nearer to the horizontal offers least resistance to the weight placed on it when the triangle a z n by settling drives backwards the of each circle that is a s and in the same way z m the reason is that a is perpendicularly over b and so likewise z is above f either half of an arch if overweighted will break at of its height the point which corresponds to the perpendicular line above the middle of its bases as is seen at a b and this happens because the weight tends to fall past the point r and if against its nature it should tend to fall towards the point s the arch n s would break precisely in its middle if the arch n s were of a single piece of timber if the weight placed at n should tend to fall in the line n m the arch would break in the middle of the arch e m otherwise it will break at one third from the top at the point a because from a to n the arch is nearer to the horizontal than from a to o and from o to s in proportion as p t is greater than t n a o will be stronger than a n and likewise in proportion as s o is stronger than o a r p will be greater than p t the arch which is doubled to four times of its thickness will bear four times the weight that the single arch could carry and more in proportion as the diameter of its thickness goes a smaller number of times into its length that is to say that if the thickness of the single arch goes ten times into its length the thickness of the doubled arch will go five times into its length hence as the thickness of the double arch goes only half as many times into its length as that of the single arch does it is reasonable that it should carry half as much more weight as it would have to carry if it were in direct proportion to the single arch hence as this double arch has times the thickness of the single arch it would seem that it ought to bear times the weight but by the above rule it is shown that it will bear exactly times as much that pier which is charged most unequally will soonest give way the column c b being charged with an equal weight on each side will be most durable and the other two outward columns require on the part outside of their centre as much pressure as there is inside of their centre that is from the centre of the column towards the middle of the arch arches which depend on chains for their support will not be very durable that arch will be of longer duration which has a good abutment opposed to its thrust the arch itself tends to fall if the arch be braccia and the interval between the walls which carry it be we know that cannot pass through the unless becomes likewise hence the arch being crushed by the excess of weight and the walls offering insufficient resistance part and afford room between them for the fall of the arch but if you do not wish to strengthen the arch with an iron tie you must give it such abutments as can resist the thrust and you can do this thus fill up the spandrels m n with stones and direct the lines of the joints between them to the centre of the circle of the arch and the reason why this makes the arch durable is this we know very well that if the arch is loaded with an excess of weight above its quarter as a b the wall f g will be thrust outwards because the arch would yield in that direction if the other quarter b c were loaded the wall f g would be thrust inwards if it were not for the line of stones x y which resists this plan here it is shown how the arches made in the side of the octagon thrust the piers of the angles outwards as is shown by the line h c and by the line t d which thrust out the pier m that is they tend to force it away from the centre of such an octagon an experiment to show that a weight placed on an arch does not discharge itself entirely on its columns on the contrary the greater the weight placed on the arches the less the arch transmits the weight to the columns the experiment is the following let a man be placed on a steel yard in the middle of the shaft of a well then let him spread out his hands and feet between the walls of the well and you will see him weigh much less on the steel yard give him a weight on the shoulders you will see by experiment that the greater the weight you give him the greater effort he will make in spreading his arms and legs and in pressing against the wall and the less weight will be thrown on the steel yard iv on foundations the nature of the ground and supports the first and most important thing is stability as to the foundations of the component parts of temples and other public buildings the depths of the foundations must bear the same proportions to each other as the weight of material which is to be placed upon them every part of the depth of earth in a given space is composed of layers and each layer is composed of heavier or lighter materials the lowest being the heaviest and this can be proved because these layers have been formed by the sediment from water carried down to the sea by the current of rivers which flow into it the heaviest part of this sediment was that which was first thrown down and so on by degrees and this is the action of water when it becomes stagnant having first brought down the mud whence it first flowed and such layers of soil are seen in the banks of rivers where their constant flow has cut through them and divided one slope from the other to a great depth where in gravelly strata the waters have run off the materials have in consequence dried and been converted into hard stone and this happened most in what was the finest mud whence we conclude that every portion of the surface of the earth was once at the centre of the earth and vice versa c the heaviest part of the foundations of buildings settles most and leaves the lighter part above it separated from it and the soil which is most pressed if it be porous yields most you should always make the foundations project equally beyond the weight of the walls and piers as shown at m a b if you do as many do that is to say if you make a foundation of equal width from the bottom up to the surface of the ground and charge it above with unequal weights as shown at b e and at e o at the part of the foundation at b e the pier of the angle will weigh most and thrust its foundation downwards which the wall at e o will not do since it does not cover the whole of its foundation and therefore thrusts less heavily and settles less hence the pier b e in settling cracks and parts from the wall e o this may be seen in most buildings which are cracked round the piers the window a is well placed under the window c and the window b is badly placed under the pier d because this latter is without support and foundation mind therefore never to make a break under the piers between the windows of the supports a pillar of which the thickness is increased will gain more than its due strength in direct proportion to what its loses in relative height example if a pillar should be nine times as high as it is broad that is to say if it is one braccio thick according to rule it should be nine braccia high then if you place such pillars together in a mass this will be ten braccia broad and high and if the first pillar could carry pounds the second being only about as high as it is wide and thus lacking parts of its proper length it that is to say each pillar thus united will bear eight times more than when disconnected that is to say that if at first it would carry ten thousand pounds it would now carry thousand v on the resistance of beams that angle will offer the greatest resistance which is most acute and the most obtuse will be the weakest footnote the three smaller sketches accompany the text in the original but the larger one is not directly connected with it it is to be found on fol a of the same manuscript and there we read in a note written underneath coverchio della perdicha del castello roof of the flagstaff of the castle compare also pl xciii no if the beams and the weight o are pounds how much weight will be wanted at ae to resist such a weight that it may not fall down on the length of beams that beam which is more than times as long as its greatest thickness will be of brief duration and will break in half and remember that the part built into the wall should be steeped in hot pitch and filleted with oak boards likewise so steeped each beam must pass through its walls and be secured beyond the walls with sufficient chaining because in consequence of earthquakes the beams are often seen to come out of the walls and bring down the walls and floors whilst if they are chained they will hold the walls strongly together and the walls will hold the floors again i remind you never to put plaster over timber since by expansion and shrinking of the timber produced by damp and dryness such floors often crack and once cracked their divisions gradually produce dust and an ugly effect again remember not to lay a floor on beams supported on arches for in time the floor which is made on beams settles somewhat in the middle while that part of the floor which rests on the arches remains in its place hence floors laid over two kinds of supports look in time as if they were made in hills footnote m ravaisson in his edition of ms a gives a very different rendering of this passage translating it thus les planchers qui sont soutenus par deux differentes natures de supports paraissent avec le temps faits en voute a cholli remarks on the style of leonardo s architecture a few remarks may here be added on the style of leonardo s architectural studies however incomplete however small in scale they allow us to establish a certain number of facts and probabilities well worthy of consideration when leonardo began his studies the great name of brunellesco was still the inspiration of all florence and we cannot doubt that leonardo was open to it since we find among his sketches the plan of the church of santo spirito footnote see pl xciv no then only in course of erection after the designs of brunellesco though he was already dead finished in and a lateral view of san lorenzo pl xciv no a plan almost identical with the chapel degli angeli only begun by him pl xciv no while among leonardo s designs for domes several clearly betray the influence of brunellesco s cupola and the lantern of santa maria del fiore footnote a small sketch of the tower of the palazzo della signoria ms c a proves that he also studied mediaeval monuments the beginning of the second period of modern italian architecture falls during the first twenty years of leonardo s life however the new impetus given by leon battista alberti either was not generally understood by his contemporaries or those who appreciated it had no opportunity of showing that they did so it was only when taken up by bramante and developed by him to the highest rank of modern architecture that this new influence was generally felt now the peculiar feature of leonardo s sketches is that like the works of bramante they appear to be the development and continuation of alberti s but a question here occurs which is difficult to answer did leonardo till he quitted florence follow the direction given by the dominant school of brunellesco which would then have given rise to his first manner or had he even before he left florence felt alberti s influence either through his works palazzo ruccellai and the front of santa maria novella or through personal intercourse or was it not till he went to milan that alberti s work began to impress him through bramante who probably had known alberti at mantua about and who not only carried out alberti s views and ideas but by his designs for st peter s at rome proved himself the greatest of modern architects when leonardo went to milan bramante had already been living there for many years one of his earliest works in milan was the church of santa maria presso san satiro via del falcone footnote evidence of this i intend to give later on in a life of bramante which i have in preparation now we find among leonardos studies of cupolas on plates lxxxiv and lxxxv and in pl lxxx several sketches which seem to me to have been suggested by bramante s dome of this church the mss b and ash ii contain the plans of s sepolcro the pavilion in the garden of the duke of milan and two churches evidently inspired by the church of san lorenzo at milan ms b contains besides two notes relating to pavia one of them a design for the sacristy of the cathedral at pavia which cannot be supposed to be dated later than and it has probably some relation to leonardo s call to pavia june footnote the sketch of the plan of brunellesco s church of santo spirito at florence which occurs in the same manuscript may have been done from memory these and other considerations justify us in concluding that leonardo made his studies of cupolas at milan probably between the years and in anticipation of the erection of one of the grandest churches of italy the cathedral of pavia this may explain the decidedly lombardo bramantesque tendency in the style of these studies among which only a few remind us of the forms of the cupolas of s maria del fiore and of the baptistery of florence thus although when compared with bramante s work several of these sketches plainly reveal that master s influence we find among the sketches of domes some which show already bramante s classic style of which the tempietto of san pietro in montorio his first building executed at rome is the foremost example footnote it may be mentioned here that in bramante made a similar design for the lantern of the cupola of the church of santa maria delle grazie on plate lxxxiv is a sketch of the plan of a similar circular building and the mausoleum on pl xcviii no less than one of the pedestals for the statue of francesco sforza pl lxv is of the same type the drawings pl lxxxiv no pl lxxxvi no and and the ground flour flour sic but should be floor of the building in the drawing pl xci no with the interesting decoration by gigantic statues in large niches are also i believe more in the style bramante adopted at rome than in the lombard style are we to conclude from this that leonardo on his part influenced bramante in the sense of simplifying his style and rendering it more congenial to antique art the answer to this important question seems at first difficult to give for we are here in presence of bramante the greatest of modern architects and with leonardo the man comparable with no other we have no knowledge of any buildings erected by leonardo and unless we admit personal intercourse which seems probable but of which there is no proof it would be difficult to understand how leonardo could have affected bramante s style the converse is more easily to be admitted since bramante as we have proved elsewhere drew and built simultaneously in different manners and though in lombardy there is no building by him in his classic style the use of brick for building in that part of italy may easily account for it bramante s name is incidentally mentioned in leonardo s manuscripts in two passages nos and on each occasion it is only a slight passing allusion and the nature of the context gives us no due information as to any close connection between the two artists it might be supposed on the ground of leonardo s relations with the east given in sections xvii and xxi of this volume that some evidence of oriental influence might be detected in his architectural drawings i do not however think that any such traces can be pointed out with certainty unless perhaps the drawing for a mausoleum pl xc viii among several studies for the construction of cupolas above a greek cross there are some in which the forms are decidedly monotonous these it is clear were not designed as models of taste they must be regarded as the results of certain investigations into the laws of proportion harmony and contrast the designs for churches on the plan of a latin cross are evidently intended to depart as little as possible from the form of a greek cross and they also show a preference for a nave surrounded with outer porticos the architectural forms preferred by leonardo are pilasters coupled pl lxxxii no or grouped pl lxxx no and xciv no often combined with niches we often meet with orders superposed one in each story or two small orders on one story in combination with one great order pl xcvi no the drum tamburo of these cupolas is generally octagonal as in the cathedral of florence and with similar round windows in its sides in pl lxxxvii no it is circular like the model actually carried out by michael angelo at st peter s the cupola itself is either hidden under a pyramidal roof as in the baptistery of florence san lorenzo of milan and most of the lombard churches pl xci no and pl xcii no but it more generally suggests the curve of sta maria del fiore pl lxxxviii no pl xc no pl lxxxix m pl xc no pl xcvi no in other cases pl lxxx no pl lxxxix pl xc no it shows the sides of the octagon crowned by semicircular pediments as in brunellesco s lantern of the cathedral and in the model for the cathedral of pavia finally in some sketches the cupola is either semicircular or as in pl lxxxvii no shows the beautiful line adopted sixty years later by michael angelo for the existing dome of st peter s it is worth noticing that for all these domes leonardo is not satisfied to decorate the exterior merely with ascending ribs or mouldings but employs also a system of horizontal parallels to complete the architectural system not the least interesting are the designs for the tiburio cupola of the milan cathedral they show some of the forms just mentioned adapted to the peculiar gothic style of that monument the few examples of interiors of churches recall the style employed in lombardy by bramante for instance in s maria di canepanuova at pavia or by dolcebuono in the monastero maggiore at milan see pl ci no c a b b pl lxxxiv no the few indications concerning palaces seem to prove that leonardo followed alberti s example

ciii no ms b is a pen and ink drawing of a vase which also seems intended for a fountain three handles seem to have been intended to connect the upper parts with the base there can be no doubt that leonardo like bramante but unlike michael angelo brought infinite delicacy of motive and execution to bear on the details of his work xiv anatomy zoology and physiology leonardo s eminent place in the history of medicine as a pioneer in the sciences of anatomy and physiology will never be appreciated till it is possible to publish the mass of manuscripts in which he largely treated of these two branches of learning in the present work i must necessarily limit myself to giving the reader a general view of these labours by publishing his introductory notes to the various books on anatomical subjects i have added some extracts and such observations as are scattered incidentally through these treatises as serving to throw a light on leonardo s scientific attitude besides having an interest for a wider circle than that of specialists only vasari expressly mentions leonardo s anatomical studies having had occasion to examine the manuscript books which refer to them according to him leonardo studied anatomy in the companionship of marc antonio della torre aiutato e scambievolmente aiutando this learned anatomist taught the science in the universities first of padua and then of pavia and at pavia he and leonardo may have worked and studied together we have no clue to any exact dates but in the year marc antonio della torre seems to have not yet left padua he was scarcely thirty years old when he died in and his writings on anatomy have not only never been published but no manuscript copy of them is known to exist this is not the place to enlarge on the connection between leonardo and marc antonio della torre i may however observe that i have not been able to discover in leonardo s manuscripts on anatomy any mention of his younger contemporary the few quotations which occur from writers on medicine either of antiquity or of the middle ages are printed in section xxii here and there in the manuscripts mention is made of an anonymous adversary avversario whose views are opposed and refuted by leonardo but there is no ground for supposing that marc antonio della torre should have been this adversary only a very small selection from the mass of anatomical drawings left by leonardo have been published here in facsimile but to form any adequate idea of their scientific merit they should be compared with the coarse and inadequate figures given in the published books of the early part of the xvi century william hunter the great surgeon a competent judge who had an opportunity in the time of george iii of seeing the originals in the king s library has thus recorded his opinion i expected to see little more than such designs in anatomy as might be useful to a painter in his own profession but i saw and indeed with astonishment that leonardo had been a general and deep student when i consider what pains he has taken upon every part of the body the superiority of his universal genius his particular excellence in mechanics and hydraulics and the attention with which such a man would examine and see objects which he has to draw i am fully persuaded that leonardo was the best anatomist at that time in the world leonardo was certainly the first man we know of who introduced the practice of making anatomical drawings two introductory letters london pages and the illustrious german naturalist johan friedrich blumenback esteemed them no less highly he was one of the privileged few who after hunter had the chance of seeing these manuscripts he writes der scharfblick dieses grossen forschers und darstellers der natur hat schon auf dinge geachtet die noch jahrhunderte nachher unbemerkt geblieben sind see blumenbach s medicinische bibliothek vol st page these opinions were founded on the drawings alone up to the present day hardly anything has been made known of the text and for the reasons i have given it is my intention to reproduce here no more than a selection of extracts which i have made from the originals at windsor castle and elsewhere in the bibliography of the manuscripts at the end of this volume a short review is given of the valuable contents of these anatomical note books which are at present almost all in the possession of her majesty the queen of england it is i believe possible to assign the date with approximate accuracy to almost all the fragments and i am thus led to conclude that the greater part of leonardo s anatomical investigations were carried out after the death of della torre merely in reading the introductory notes to his various books on anatomy which are here printed it is impossible to resist the impression that the master s anatomical studies bear to a very great extent the stamp of originality and independent thought i anatomy a general introduction i wish to work miracles it may be that i shall possess less than other men of more peaceful lives or than those who want to grow rich in a day i may live for a long time in great poverty as always happens and to all eternity will happen to alchemists the would be creators of gold and silver and to engineers who would have dead water stir itself into life and perpetual motion and to those supreme fools the necromancer and the enchanter footnote the following seems to be directed against students of painting and young artists rather than against medical men and anatomists and you who say that it would be better to watch an anatomist at work than to see these drawings you would be right if it were possible to observe all the things which are demonstrated in such drawings in a single figure in which you with all your cleverness will not see nor obtain knowledge of more than some few veins to obtain a true and perfect knowledge of which i have dissected more than ten human bodies destroying all the other members and removing the very minutest particles of the flesh by which these veins are surrounded without causing them to bleed excepting the insensible bleeding of the capillary veins and as one single body would not last so long since it was necessary to proceed with several bodies by degrees until i came to an end and had a complete knowledge this i repeated twice to learn the differences footnote lines and are written in two parallel columns when we here find leonardo putting himself in the same category as the alchemists and necromancers whom he elsewhere mocks at so bitterly it is evidently meant ironically in the same way leonardo in the introduction to the books on perspective sets himself with transparent satire on a level with other writers on the subject and if you should have a love for such things you might be prevented by loathing and if that did not prevent you you might be deterred by the fear of living in the night hours in the company of those corpses quartered and flayed and horrible to see and if this did not prevent you perhaps you might not be able to draw so well as is necessary for such a demonstration or if you had the skill in drawing it might not be combined with knowledge of perspective and if it were so you might not understand the methods of geometrical demonstration and the method of the calculation of forces and of the strength of the muscles patience also may be wanting so that you lack perseverance as to whether all these things were found in me or not footnote leonardo frequently and perhaps habitually wrote in note books of a very small size and only moderately thick in most of those which have been preserved undivided each contains less than fifty leaves thus a considerable number of such volumes must have gone to make up a volume of the bulk of the codex atlanticus which now contains nearly detached leaves in the passage under consideration which was evidently written at a late period of his life leonardo speaks of his manuscript note books as numbering o but we should hardly be justified in concluding from this passage that the greater part of his manuscripts were now missing see prolegomena vol i pp the hundred and twenty books composed by me will give verdict yes or no in these i have been hindered neither by avarice nor negligence but simply by want of time farewell plans and suggestions for the arrangement of materials of the order of the book this work must begin with the conception of man and describe the nature of the womb and how the foetus lives in it up to what stage it resides there and in what way it quickens into life and feeds also its growth and what interval there is between one stage of growth and another what it is that forces it out from the body of the mother and for what reasons it sometimes comes out of the mother s womb before the due time then i will describe which are the members which after the boy is born grow more than the others and determine the proportions of a boy of one year then describe the fully grown man and woman with their proportions and the nature of their complexions colour and physiognomy then how they are composed of veins tendons muscles and bones this i shall do at the end of the book then in four drawings represent four universal conditions of men that is mirth with various acts of laughter and describe the cause of laughter weeping in various aspects with its causes contention with various acts of killing flight fear ferocity boldness murder and every thing pertaining to such cases then represent labour with pulling thrusting carrying stopping supporting and such like things further i would describe attitudes and movements then perspective concerning the functions and effects of the eye and of hearing here i will speak of music and treat of the other senses and then describe the nature of the senses this mechanism of man we will demonstrate in figures of which the three first will show the ramification of the bones that is first one to show their height and position and shape the second will be seen in profile and will show the depth of the whole and of the parts and their position the third figure will be a demonstration of the bones of the backparts then i will make three other figures from the same point of view with the bones sawn across in which will be shown their thickness and hollowness three other figures of the bones complete and of the nerves which rise from the nape of the neck and in what limbs they ramify and three others of the bones and veins and where they ramify then three figures with the muscles and three with the skin and their proper proportions and three of woman to illustrate the womb and the menstrual veins which go to the breasts footnote the meaning of the word nervo varies in different passages being sometimes used for muscolo muscle the order of the book this depicting of mine of the human body will be as clear to you as if you had the natural man before you and the reason is that if you wish thoroughly to know the parts of man anatomically you or your eye require to see it from different aspects considering it from below and from above and from its sides turning it about and seeking the origin of each member and in this way the natural anatomy is sufficient for your comprehension but you must understand that this amount of knowledge will not continue to satisfy you seeing the very great confusion that must result from the combination of tissues with veins arteries nerves sinews muscles bones and blood which of itself tinges every part the same colour and the veins which discharge this blood are not discerned by reason of their smallness moreover integrity of the tissues in the process of the investigating the parts within them is inevitably destroyed and their transparent substance being tinged with blood does not allow you to recognise the parts covered by them from the similarity of their blood stained hue and you cannot know everything of the one without confusing and destroying the other hence some further anatomy drawings become necessary of which you want three to give full knowledge of the veins and arteries everything else being destroyed with the greatest care and three others to display the tissues and three for the sinews and muscles and ligaments and three for the bones and cartilages and three for the anatomy of the bones which have to be sawn to show which are hollow and which are not which have marrow and which are spongy and which are thick from the outside inwards and which are thin and some are extremely thin in some parts and thick in others and in some parts hollow or filled up with bone or full of marrow or spongy and all these conditions are sometimes found in one and the same bone and in some bones none of them and three you must have for the woman in which there is much that is mysterious by reason of the womb and the foetus therefore by my drawings every part will be known to you and all by means of demonstrations from three different points of view of each part for when you have seen a limb from the front with any muscles sinews or veins which take their rise from the opposite side the same limb will be shown to you in a side view or from behind exactly as if you had that same limb in your hand and were turning it from side to side until you had acquired a full comprehension of all you wished to know in the same way there will be put before you three or four demonstrations of each limb from various points of view so that you will be left with a true and complete knowledge of all you wish to learn of the human figure footnote compare pl cvii the original drawing at windsor is x centimetres the upper figures are slightly washed with indian ink on the back of this drawing is the text no thus in twelve entire figures you will have set before you the cosmography of this lesser world on the same plan as before me was adopted by ptolemy in his cosmography and so i will afterwards divide them into limbs as he divided the whole world into provinces then i will speak of the function of each part in every direction putting before your eyes a description of the whole form and substance of man as regards his movements from place to place by means of his different parts and thus if it please our great author i may demonstrate the nature of men and their customs in the way i describe his figure and remember that the anatomy of the nerves will not give the position of their ramifications nor show you which muscles they branch into by means of bodies dissected in running water or in lime water though indeed their origin and starting point may be seen without such water as well as with it but their ramifications when under running water cling and unite just like flat or hemp carded for spinning all into a skein in a way which makes it impossible to trace in which muscles or by what ramification the nerves are distributed among those muscles the arrangement of anatomy first draw the bones let us say of the arm and put in the motor muscle from the shoulder to the elbow with all its lines then proceed in the same way from the elbow to the wrist then from the wrist to the hand and from the hand to the fingers and in the arm you will put the motors of the fingers which open and these you will show separately in their demonstration in the second demonstration you will clothe these muscles with the secondary motors of the fingers and so proceed by degrees to avoid confusion but first lay on the bones those muscles which lie close to the said bones without confusion of other muscles and with these you may put the nerves and veins which supply their nourishment after having first drawn the tree of veins and nerves over the simple bones begin the anatomy at the head and finish at the sole of the foot men complete with bones and nerves with the bones only here we have demonstrations of entire figures when you have finished building up the man you will make the statue with all its superficial measurements footnote cresciere l omo the meaning of this expression appears to be different here and in the passage c a a a see no note here it can hardly mean anything else than modelling since the sculptor forms the figure by degrees by adding wet clay and the figure consequently increases or grows tu farai la statua would then mean you must work out the figure in marble if this interpretation is the correct one this passage would have no right to find a place in the series on anatomical studies i may say that it was originally inserted in this connection under the impression that di cresciere should be read descrivere plans for the representation of muscles by drawings you must show all the motions of the bones with their joints to follow the demonstration of the first three figures of the bones and this should be done in the first book remember that to be certain of the point of origin of any muscle you must pull the sinew from which the muscle springs in such a way as to see that muscle move and where it is attached to the ligaments of the bones note you will never get any thing but confusion in demonstrating the muscles and their positions origin and termination unless you first make a demonstration of thin muscles after the manner of linen threads and thus you can represent them one over another as nature has placed them and thus too you can name them according to the limb they serve for instance the motor of the point of the great toe of its middle bone of its first bone c and when you have the knowledge you will draw by the side of this the true form and size and position of each muscle but remember to give the threads which explain the situation of the muscles in the position which corresponds to the central line of each muscle and so these threads will demonstrate the form of the leg and their distance in a plain and clear manner i have removed the skin from a man who was so shrunk by illness that the muscles were worn down and remained in a state like thin membrane in such a way that the sinews instead of merging in muscles ended in wide membrane and where the bones were covered by the skin they had very little over their natural size footnote the photograph no of grosvenor gallery publications a drawing of the muscles of the foot includes a complete facsimile of the text of this passage which nerve causes the motion of the eye so that the motion of one eye moves the other of frowning the brows of raising the brows

the hip in all views and in every action and in every state veins arteries nerves sinews and muscles skin and bones then the bones in sections to show the thickness of the bones footnote a straightened leg in profile is sketched by the side of this text on corpulency and leanness make the rule and give the measurement of each muscle and give the reasons of all their functions and in which way they work and what makes them work c first draw the spine of the back then clothe it by degrees one after the other with each of its muscles and put in the nerves and arteries and veins to each muscle by itself and besides these note the vertebrae to which they are attached which of the intestines come in contact with them and which bones and other organs c the most prominent parts of lean people are most prominent in the muscular and equally so in fat persons but concerning the difference in the forms of the muscles in fat persons as compared with muscular persons it shall be described below footnote the two drawings given on pl cviii no come between lines and a good and very early copy of this drawing without the written text exists in the collection of drawings belonging to christ s college oxford where it is attributed to leonardo describe which muscles disappear in growing fat and which become visible in growing lean and observe that that part which on the surface of a fat person is most concave when he grows lean becomes more prominent where the muscles separate one from another you must give profiles and where they coalesce of the human figure which is the part in man which as he grows fatter never gains flesh or what part which as a man grows lean never falls away with a too perceptible diminution and among the parts which grow fat which is that which grows fattest among those which grow lean which is that which grows leanest in very strong men which are the muscles which are thickest and most prominent in your anatomy you must represent all the stages of the limbs from man s creation to his death and then till the death of the bone and which part of him is first decayed and which is preserved the longest and in the same way of extreme

positions of the wings of birds in downward flight footnote a passing allusion is all i can here permit myself to leonardo s elaborate researches into the flight of birds compare the observations on this subject in the introduction to section xviii and in the bibliography of manuscripts at the end of the work of the way in which the tail of a fish acts in propelling the fish as in the eel snake

muscles then in continuation the hind legs of the hare which are very muscular with strong active muscles because they are not encumbered with fat footnote this text is written by the side of a drawing in black chalk of a nude male figure but there is no connection between the sketch and the text here i make a note to demonstrate the difference there is between man and the horse and in the same way with other animals and first i will begin with the bones and then will go on to all the muscles which spring from the bones without tendons and end in them in the same way and then go on to those which start with a single tendon at one end footnote see pl cviii no note on the bendings of joints and in what way the flesh grows upon them in their flexions or extensions and of this most important study write a separate treatise in the description of the movements of animals with four feet among which is man who likewise in his infancy crawls on all fours of the way of walking in man the walking of man is always after the universal manner of walking in animals with legs inasmuch as just as they move their feet crosswise after the manner of a horse in trotting so man moves his limbs crosswise that is if he puts forward his right foot in walking he puts forward with it his left arm and vice versa invariably iii physiology comparative study of the organs of sense in men and animals i have found that in the composition of the human body as compared with the bodies of animals the organs of sense are duller and coarser thus it is composed of less ingenious instruments and of spaces less capacious for receiving the faculties of sense i have seen in the lion tribe that the sense of smell is connected with part of the substance of the brain which comes down the nostrils which form a spacious receptacle for the sense of smell which enters by a great number of cartilaginous vesicles with several passages leading up to where the brain as before said comes down the eyes in the lion tribe have a large part of the head for their sockets and the optic nerves communicate at once with the brain but the contrary is to be seen in man for the sockets of the eyes are but a small part of the head and the optic nerves are very fine and long and weak and by the weakness of their action we see by day but badly at night while these animals can see as well at night as by day the proof that they can see is that they prowl for prey at night and sleep by day as nocturnal birds do also advantages in the structure of the eye in certain animals every object we see will appear larger at midnight than at midday and larger in the morning than at midday this happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday than at any other time in proportion as the eye or the pupil of the owl is larger in proportion to the animal than that of man so much the more light can it see at night than man can hence at midday it can see nothing if its pupil does not diminish and in the same way at night things look larger to it than by day of the eyes in animals the eyes of all animals have their pupils adapted to dilate and diminish of their own accord in proportion to the greater or less light of the sun or other luminary but in birds the variation is much greater and particularly in nocturnal birds such as horned owls and in the eyes of one species of owl in these the pupil dilates in such away as to occupy nearly the whole eye or diminishes to the size of a grain of millet and always preserves the circular form but in the lion tribe as panthers pards ounces tigers lynxes spanish cats and other similar animals the pupil diminishes from the perfect circle to the figure of a pointed oval such as is shown in the margin but man having a weaker sight than any other animal is less hurt by a very strong light and his pupil increases but little in dark places but in the eyes of these nocturnal animals the horned owl a bird which is the largest of all nocturnal birds the power of vision increases so much that in the faintest nocturnal light which we call darkness it sees with much more distinctness than we do in the splendour of noon day at which time these birds remain hidden in dark holes or if indeed they are compelled to come out into the open air lighted up by the sun they contract their pupils so much that their power of sight diminishes together with the quantity of light admitted study the anatomy of various eyes and see which are the muscles which open and close the said pupils of the eyes of animals footnote compare no lines and fol a b n is the membrane which closes the eye from below upwards with an opaque film c n b encloses the eye in front and behind with a transparent membrane it closes from below upwards because it the eye comes downwards when the eye of a bird closes with its two lids the first to close is the nictitating membrane which closes from the lacrymal duct over to the outer corner of the eye and the outer lid closes from below upwards and these two intersecting motions begin first from the lacrymatory duct because we have already seen that in front and below birds are protected and use only the upper portion of the eye from fear of birds of prey which come down from above and behind and they uncover first the membrane from the outer corner because if the enemy comes from behind they have the power of escaping to the front and again the muscle called the nictitating membrane is transparent because if the eye had not such a screen they could not keep it open against the wind which strikes against the eye in the rush of their rapid flight and the pupil of the eye dilates and contracts as it sees a less or greater light that is to say intense brilliancy if at night your eye is placed between the light and the eye of a cat it will see the eye look like fire remarks on the organs of speech a e i o u ba be bi bo bu ca ce ci co cu da de di do du fa fe fi fo fu ga ge gi go gu la le li lo lu ma me

of the false palate which is above the epiglottis if you draw in breath by the nose and send it out by the mouth you will hear the sound made by the division that is the membrane in footnote the text here breaks off on the conditions of sight of the nature of sight i say that sight is exercised by all animals by the medium of light and if any one adduces as against this the sight of nocturnal animals i must say that this in the same way is subject to the very same natural laws for it will easily be understood that the senses which receive the images of things do not project from themselves any visual virtue footnote compare no on the contrary the atmospheric medium which exists between the object and the sense incorporates in itself the figure of things and by its contact with the sense transmits the object to it if the object whether by sound or by odour presents its spiritual force to the ear or the nose then light is not required and does not act the forms of objects do not send their images into the air if they are not illuminated and the eye being thus constituted cannot receive that from the air which the air does not possess although it touches its surface if you choose to say that there are many animals that prey at night i answer that when the little light which suffices the nature of their eyes is wanting they direct themselves by their strong sense of hearing and of smell which are not impeded by the darkness and in which they are very far superior to man if you make a cat leap by daylight among a quantity of jars and crocks you will see them remain unbroken but if you do the same at night many will be broken night birds do not fly about unless the moon shines full or in part rather do they feed between sun down and the total darkness of the night footnote see no no body can be apprehended without light and shade and light and shade are caused by light why men advanced in age see better at a distance sight is better from a distance than near in those men who are advancing in age because the same object transmits a smaller impression of itself to the eye when it is distant than when it is near the seat of the common sense the common sense is that which judges of things offered to it by the other senses the ancient speculators have concluded that that part of man which constitutes his judgment is caused by a central organ to which the other five senses refer everything by means of impressibility and to this centre they have given the name common sense and they say that this sense is situated in the centre of the head between sensation and memory and this name of common sense is given to it solely because it is the common judge of all the other five senses i e seeing hearing touch taste and smell this common sense is acted upon by means of sensation which is placed as a medium between it and the senses sensation is acted upon by means of the images of things presented to it by the external instruments that is to say the senses which are the medium between external things and sensation in the same way the senses are acted upon by objects surrounding things transmit their images to the senses and the senses transfer them to the sensation sensation sends them to the common sense and by it they are stamped upon the memory and are there more or less retained according to the importance or force of the impression that sense is most rapid in its function which is nearest to the sensitive medium and the eye being the highest is the chief of the others of this then only we will speak and the others we will leave in order not to make our matter too long experience tells us that the eye apprehends ten different natures of things that is light and darkness one being the cause of the perception of the nine others and the other its absence colour and substance form and place distance and nearness motion and stillness footnote compare no on the origin of the soul though human ingenuity may make various inventions which by the help of various machines answering the same end it will never devise any inventions more beautiful nor more simple nor more to the purpose than nature does because in her inventions nothing is wanting and nothing is superfluous and she needs no counterpoise when she makes limbs proper for motion in the bodies of animals but she puts into them the soul of the body which forms them that is the soul of the mother which first constructs in the womb the form of the man and in due time awakens the soul that is to inhabit it and this at first lies dormant and under the tutelage of the soul of the mother who nourishes and vivifies it by the umbilical vein with all its spiritual parts and this happens because this umbilicus is joined to the placenta and the cotyledons by which the child is attached to the mother and these are the reason why a wish a strong craving or a fright or any other mental suffering in the mother has more influence on the child than on the mother for there are many cases when the child loses its life from them c this discourse is not in its place here but will be wanted for the one on the composition of animated bodies and the rest of the definition of the soul i leave to the imaginations of friars those fathers of the people who know all secrets by inspiration footnote lettere incoronate by this term leonardo probably understands not the bible only but the works of the early fathers and all the books recognised as sacred by the roman church i leave alone the sacred books for they are supreme truth on the relations of the soul to the organs of sense how the five senses are the ministers of the soul the soul seems to reside in the judgment and the judgment would seem to be seated in that part where all the senses meet and this is called the common sense and is not all pervading throughout the body as many have thought rather is it entirely in one part because if it were all pervading and the same in every part there would have been no need to make the instruments of the senses meet in one centre and in one single spot on the contrary it would have sufficed that the eye should fulfil the function of its sensation on its surface only and not transmit the image of the things seen to the sense by means of the optic nerves so that the soul for the reason given above may perceive it in the surface of the eye in the same way as to the sense of hearing it would have sufficed if the voice had merely sounded in the porous cavity of the indurated portion of the temporal bone which lies within the ear without making any farther transit from this bone to the common sense where the voice confers with and discourses to the common judgment the sense of smell again is compelled by necessity to refer itself to that same judgment feeling passes through the perforated cords and is conveyed to this common sense these cords diverge with infinite ramifications into the skin which encloses the members of the body and the viscera the perforated cords convey volition and sensation to the subordinate limbs these cords and the nerves direct the motions of the muscles and sinews between which they are placed these obey and this obedience takes effect by reducing their thickness for in swelling their length is reduced and the nerves shrink which are interwoven among the particles of the limbs being extended to the tips of the fingers they transmit to the sense the object which they touch the nerves with their muscles obey the tendons as soldiers obey the officers and the tendons obey the common central sense as the officers obey the general thus the joint of the bones obeys the nerve and the nerve the muscle and the muscle the tendon and the tendon the common sense and the common sense is the seat of the soul and memory is its ammunition and the impressibility is its referendary since the sense waits on the soul and not the soul on the sense and where the sense that ministers to the soul is not at the service of the soul all the functions of that sense are also wanting in that man s life as is seen in those born mute and blind footnote the peculiar use of the words nervo muscolo corda senso comune which are here literally rendered by nerve muscle cord or tendon and common sense may be understood from lines and on involuntary muscular action how the nerves sometimes act of themselves without any commands from the other functions of the soul this is most plainly seen for you will see palsied and shivering persons move and their trembling limbs as their head and hands quake without leave from their soul and their soul with all its power cannot prevent their members from trembling the same thing happens in falling sickness or in parts that have been cut off as in the tails of lizards the

support of life how the body of animals is constantly dying and being renewed the body of any thing whatever that takes nourishment constantly dies and is constantly renewed because nourishment can only enter into places where the former nourishment has expired and if it has expired it no longer has life and if you do not supply nourishment equal to the nourishment which is gone life will fail in vigour and if you take away this nourishment the life is entirely destroyed but if you restore as much is destroyed day by day then as much of the life is renewed as is consumed just as the flame of the candle is fed by the nourishment afforded by the liquid of this candle which flame continually with a rapid supply restores to it from below as much as is consumed in dying above and from a brilliant light is converted in dying into murky smoke and this death is continuous as the smoke is continuous and the continuance of the smoke is equal to the continuance of the nourishment and in the same instant all the flame is dead and all regenerated simultaneously with the movement of its own nourishment king of the animals as thou hast described him i should rather say king of the beasts thou being the greatest because thou hast spared slaying them in order that they may give thee their children for the benefit of the gullet of which thou hast attempted to make a sepulchre for all animals and i would say still more if it were allowed me to speak the entire truth but we do not go outside human matters in telling of one supreme wickedness which does not happen among the animals of the earth inasmuch as among them are found none who eat their own kind unless through want of sense few indeed among them and those being mothers as with men albeit they be not many in number and this happens only among the rapacious animals as with the leonine species and leopards panthers lynxes cats and the like who sometimes eat their children but thou besides thy children devourest father mother brothers and friends nor is this enough for thee but thou goest to the chase on the islands of others taking other men and these half naked the and the thou fattenest and chasest them down thy

with others not a stepmother but a most tender mother man and animals are really the passage and the conduit of food the sepulchre of animals and resting place of the dead one causing the death of the other making themselves the covering for the corruption of other dead bodies on the circulation of the blood death in old men when not from fever is caused by the veins which go from the spleen to the valve of the liver and which thicken so much in the walls that they become closed up and leave no passage for the blood that nourishes it the incessant current of the blood through the veins makes these veins thicken and become callous so that at last they close up and prevent the passage of the blood the waters return with constant motion from the lowest depths of the sea to the utmost height of the mountains not obeying the nature of heavier bodies and in this they resemble the blood of animated beings which always moves from the sea of the heart and flows towards the top of the head and here it may burst a vein as may be seen when a vein bursts in the nose all the blood rises from below to the level of the burst vein when the water rushes out from the burst vein in the earth it obeys the law of other bodies that are heavier than the air since it always seeks low places footnote from this passage it is quite plain that leonardo had not merely a general suspicion of the circulation of the blood but a very clear conception of it leonardo s studies on the muscles of the heart are to be found in the ms w an iii but no information about them has hitherto been made public the limits of my plan in this work exclude all purely anatomical writings therefore only a very brief excerpt from this note book can be given here william harvey born and professor of anatomy at cambridge from is always considered to have been the discoverer of the circulation of the blood he studied medicine at padua in and in brought out his memorable and important work de motu cordis et sanguinis that

back of the drawing pl cviii compare also no xv astronomy ever since the publication by venturi in and libri in of some few passages of leonardo s astronomical notes scientific astronomers have frequently expressed the opinion that they must have been based on very important discoveries and that the great painter also deserved a conspicuous place in the history of this science in the passages here printed a connected view is given of his astronomical studies as they lie scattered through the manuscripts which have come down to us unlike his other purely scientific labours leonardo devotes here a good deal of attention to the opinions of the ancients though he does not follow the practice universal in his day of relying on them as authorities he only quotes them as we shall see in order to refute their arguments his researches throughout have the stamp of independent thought there is nothing in these writings to lead us to suppose that they were merely an epitome of the general learning common to the astronomers of the period as early as in the xivth century there were chairs of astronomy in the universities of padua and bologna but so late as during the entire xvith century astronomy and astrology were still closely allied it is impossible now to decide whether leonardo when living in florence became acquainted in his youth with the doctrines of paolo toscanelli the great astronomer and mathematician died of whose influence and teaching but little is now known beyond the fact that he advised and encouraged columbus to carry out his project of sailing round the world his name is nowhere mentioned by leonardo and from the dates of the manuscripts from which the texts on astronomy are taken it seems highly probable that leonardo devoted his attention to astronomical studies less in his youth than in his later years it was evidently his purpose to treat of astronomy in a connected form and in a separate work see the beginning of nos and compare also no it is quite in accordance with his general scientific thoroughness that he should propose to write a special treatise on optics as an introduction to astronomy see nos and some of the chapters belonging to this section bear the title prospettiva see nos and this being the term universally applied at the time to optics as well as perspective see vol i p note to no l at the beginning of the xvith century the ptolemaic theory of the universe was still universally accepted as the true one and leonardo conceives of the earth as fixed with the moon and sun revolving round it as they are represented in the diagram to no he does not go into any theory of the motions of the planets with regard to these and the fixed stars he only investigates the phenomena of their luminosity the spherical form of the earth he takes for granted as an axiom from the first and he anticipates newton by pointing out the universality of gravitation not merely in the earth but even in the moon although his acute research into the nature of the moon s light and the spots on the moon did not bring to light many results of lasting importance beyond making it evident that they were a refutation of the errors of his contemporaries they contain various explanations of facts which modern science need not modify in any essential point and discoveries which history has hitherto assigned to a very much later date the ingenious theory by which he tries to explain the nature of what is known as earth shine the reflection of the sun s rays by the earth towards the moon saying that it is a peculiar refraction originating in the innumerable curved surfaces of the waves of the sea may be regarded as absurd but it must not be forgotten that he had no means of detecting the fundamental error on which he based it namely the assumption that the moon was at a relatively short distance from the earth so long as the motion of the earth round the sun remained unknown it was of course impossible to form any estimate of the moon s distance from the earth by a calculation of its parallax before the discovery of the telescope accurate astronomical observations were only possible to a very limited extent it would appear however from certain passages in the notes here printed for the first time that leonardo was in a position to study the spots in the moon more closely than he could have done with the unaided eye so far as can be gathered from the mysterious language in which the description of his instrument is wrapped he made use of magnifying glasses these do not however seem to have been constructed like a telescope telescopes were first made about as libri pointed out histoire des sciences mathematiques iii fracastoro of verona succeeded in magnifying the moon s face by an arrangement of lenses compare no note and this gives probability to leonardo s invention at a not much earlier date i the earth as a planet the earth s place in the universe the equator the line of the horizon the ecliptic the meridian these lines are those which in all their parts are equidistant from the centre of the globe the earth is not in the centre of the sun s orbit nor at the centre of the universe but in the centre of its companion elements and united with them and any one standing on the moon when it and the sun are both beneath us would see this our earth and the element of water upon it just as we see the moon and the earth would light it as it lights us the fundamental laws of the solar system force arises from dearth or abundance it is the child of physical motion and the grand child of spiritual motion and the mother and origin of gravity gravity is limited to the elements of water and earth but this force is unlimited and by it infinite worlds might be moved if instruments could be made by which the force could be generated force with physical motion and gravity with resistance are the four external powers on which all actions of mortals depend force has its origin in spiritual motion and this motion flowing through the limbs of sentient animals enlarges their muscles being enlarged by this current the muscles are shrunk in length and contract the tendons which are connected with them and this is the cause of the force of the limbs in man the quality and quantity of the force of a man are able to give birth to other forces which will be proportionally greater as the motions produced by them last longer footnote only part of this passage belongs strictly speaking to this section the principle laid down in the second paragraph is more directly connected with the notes given in the preceding section on physiology why does not the weight o remain in its place it does not remain because it has no resistance where will it move to it will move towards the centre of gravity and why by no other line because a weight which has no support falls by the shortest road to the lowest point which is the centre of the world and why does the weight know how to find it by so short a line because it is not independant and does not move about in various directions footnote this text and the sketch belonging to it are reproduced on pl cxxi let the earth turn on which side it may the surface of the waters will never move from its spherical form but will always remain equidistant from the centre of the globe granting that the earth might be removed from the centre of the globe what would happen to the water it would remain in a sphere round that centre equally thick but the sphere would have a smaller diameter than when it enclosed the earth footnote compare no lines and no supposing the earth at our antipodes which supports the ocean were to rise and stand uncovered far out of the sea but remaining almost level by what means afterwards in the course of time would mountains and vallies be formed and the rocks with their various strata each man is always in the middle of the surface of the earth and under the zenith of his own hemisphere and over the centre of the earth mem that i must first show the distance of the sun from the earth and by means of a ray passing through a small hole into a dark chamber detect its real size and besides this by means of the aqueous sphere calculate the size of the globe here it will be shown that when the sun is in the meridian of our hemisphere footnote antipodi orientali cogli occidentali the word antipodes does not here bear its literal sense but as we may infer from the simultaneous reference to inhabitants of the north and south is used as meaning men living at a distance of degrees from the zenith of the rational horizon of each observer the antipodes to the east and to the west alike and at the same time see the sun mirrored in their waters and the same is equally true of the arctic and antarctic poles if indeed they are inhabited how to prove that the earth is a planet that the earth is a star in your discourse you must prove that the earth is a star much like the moon and the glory of our universe and then you must treat of the size of various stars according to the authors the method of proving that the earth is a star first describe the eye then show how the twinkling of a star is really in the eye and why one star should twinkle more than another and how the rays from the stars originate in the eye and add that if the twinkling of the stars were really in the stars as it seems to be that this twinkling appears to be an extension as great as the diameter of the body of the star therefore the star being larger than the earth this motion effected in an instant would be a rapid doubling of the size of the star then prove that the surface of the air where it lies contiguous to fire and the surface of the fire where it ends are those into which the solar rays penetrate and transmit the images of the heavenly bodies large when they rise and small when they are on the meridian let a be the earth and n d m the surface of the air in contact with the sphere of fire h f g is the orbit of the moon or if you please of the sun then i say that when the sun appears on the horizon g its rays are seen passing through the surface of the air at a slanting angle that is o m this is not the case at d k and so it passes through a greater mass of air all of e m is a denser atmosphere beyond the sun and us there is darkness and so the air appears blue footnote compare vol i no perspective it is possible to find means by which the eye shall not see remote objects as much diminished as in natural perspective which diminishes them by reason of the convexity of the eye which necessarily intersects at its surface the pyramid of every image conveyed to the eye at a right angle on its spherical surface but by the method i here teach in the margin these pyramids are intersected at right angles close to the surface of the pupil the convex pupil of the eye can take in the whole of our hemisphere while this will show only a single star but where many small stars transmit their images to the surface of the pupil those stars are extremely small here only one star is seen but it will be large and so the moon will be seen larger and its spots of a more defined form footnote and fol telescopes were not in use till a century later compare no and page you must place close to the eye a glass filled with the water of which mention is made in number of book on natural substances footnote libro this is perhaps the number of a book in some library catalogue but it may refer on the other hand to one of the books mentioned in no l for this water makes objects which are enclosed in balls of crystalline glass appear free from the glass of the eye among the smaller objects presented to the pupil of the eye that which is closest to it will be least appreciable to the eye and at the same time the experiments here made with the power of sight show that it is not reduced to speck if the c footnote compare with this the passage in vol i no written about twenty years earlier read in the margin those objects are seen largest which come to the eye at the largest angles but the images of the objects conveyed to the pupil of the eye are distributed to the pupil exactly as they are distributed in the air and the proof of this is in what follows that when we look at the starry sky without gazing more fixedly at one star than another the sky appears all strewn with stars and their proportions to the eye are the same as in the sky and likewise the spaces between them footnote in margine lines are in the original written on the margin and above them is the diagram to which leonardo seems to refer here perspective among objects moved from the eye at equal distance that undergoes least diminution which at first was most remote when various objects are removed at equal distances farther from their original position that which was at first the farthest from the eye will diminish least and the proportion of the diminution will be in proportion to the relative distance of the objects from the eye before they were removed that is to say in the object t and the object e the proportion of their distances from the eye a is quintuple i remove each from its place and set it farther from the eye by one of the parts into which the proposition is divided hence it happens that the nearest to the eye has doubled the distance and according to the last proposition but one of this is diminished by the half of its whole size and the body e by the same motion is diminished of its whole size therefore by that same last proposition but one that which is said in this last proposition is true and this i say of the motions of the celestial bodies which are more distant by miles when setting than when overhead and yet do not increase or diminish in any sensible degree a b is the aperture through which the sun passes and if you could measure the size of the solar rays at n m you could accurately trace the real lines of the convergence of the solar rays the mirror being at a b and then show the reflected rays at equal angles to n m but as you want to have them at n m take them at the inner side of the aperture at cd where they maybe measured at the spot where the solar rays fall then place your mirror at the distance a b making the rays d b c a fall and then be reflected at equal angles towards c d and this is the best method but you must use this mirror always in the same month and the same day and hour and instant and this will be better than at no fixed time because when the sun is at a certain distance it produces a certain pyramid of rays a the side of the body in light and shade b faces the whole portion of the hemisphere bed e f and does not face any part of the darkness of the earth and the same occurs at the point o therefore the space a o is throughout of one and the same brightness and s faces only four degrees of the hemisphere d e f g h and also the whole of the earth s h which will render it darker and how much must be demonstrated by calculation footnote this passage which has perhaps a doubtful right to its place in this connection stands in the manuscript between those given in vol i as no and no the reason of the increased size of the sun in the west some mathematicians explain that the sun looks larger as it sets because the eye always sees it through a denser atmosphere alleging that objects seen through mist or through water appear larger to these i reply no because objects seen through a mist are similar in colour to those at a distance but not being similarly diminished they appear larger again nothing increases in size in smooth water and the proof of this may be seen by throwing a light on a board placed half under water but the reason why the sun looks larger is that every luminous body appears larger in proportion as it is more remote footnote lines and are thus rendered by m ravaisson in his edition of ms a de meme aucune chose ne croit dans l eau plane et tu en feras l experience en calquant un ais sous l eau compare the diagrams in vol i p on the luminosity of the earth in the universal space in my book i propose to show how the ocean and the other seas must by means of the sun make our world shine with the appearance of a moon and to the remoter worlds it looks like a star and this i shall prove show first that every light at a distance from the eye throws out rays which appear to increase the size of the luminous body and from this it follows that footnote here the text breaks off lines and fol are written in the margin the moon is cold and moist water is cold and moist thus our seas must appear to the moon as the moon does to us the waves in water magnify the image of an object reflected in it let a be the sun and n m the ruffled water b the image of the sun when the water is smooth let f be the eye which sees the image in all the waves included within the base of the triangle c e f now the sun reflected in the unruffled surface occupied the space c d while in the ruffled surface it covers all the watery space c e as is proved in the th of my perspective footnote nel quarto della mia prospettiva if this reference is to the diagrams accompanying the text as is usual with leonardo and not to some particular work the largest of the diagrams here given must be meant it is the lowest and actually the fifth but he would have called it the fourth for the text here given is preceded on the same page of the manuscript by a passage on whirlpools with the diagram belonging to it also reproduced here the words della mia prospettiva may therefore indicate that the diagram to the preceding chapter treating on a heterogeneal subject is to be excluded it is a further difficulty that this diagram belongs properly to lines and not to the preceding sentence the reflection of the sun in water is also discussed in the theoretical part of the book on painting see vol i no and it will cover more of the water in proportion as the reflected image is remote from the eye footnote in the original sketch inside the circle in the first diagram is written sole sun and to the right of it luna moon thus either of these heavenly bodies may be supposed to fill that space within the lower circle is written simulacro image in the two next diagrams at the spot here marked l the word luna is written and in the last sole is written in the top circle at a the image of the sun will be more brightly shown in small waves than in large ones and this is because the reflections or images of the sun are more numerous in the small waves than in large ones and the more numerous reflections of its radiance give a larger light than the fewer waves which intersect like the scales of a fir cone reflect the image of the sun with the greatest splendour and this is the case because the images are as many as the ridges of the waves on which the sun shines and the shadows between these waves are small and not very dark and the radiance of so many reflections together becomes united in the image which is transmitted to the eye so that these shadows are imperceptible that reflection of the sun will cover most space on the surface of the water which is most remote from the eye which sees it let a be the sun p q the reflection of the sun a b is the surface of the water in which the sun is mirrored and r the eye which sees this reflection on the surface of the water occupying the space o m c is the eye at a greater distance from the surface of the water and also from the reflection hence this reflection covers a larger space of water by the distance between n and o it is impossible that the side of a spherical mirror illuminated by the sun should reflect its radiance unless this mirror were undulating or filled with bubbles you see here the sun which lights up the moon a spherical mirror and all of its surface which faces the sun is rendered radiant whence it may be concluded that what shines in the moon is water like that of our seas and in waves as that is and that portion which does not shine consists of islands and terra firma this diagram of several spherical bodies interposed between the eye and the sun is given to show that just as the reflection of the sun is seen in each of these bodies in the same way that image may be seen in each curve of the waves of the sea and as in these many spheres many reflections of the sun are seen so in many waves there are many images each of which at a great distance is much magnified to the eye and as this happens with each wave the spaces interposed between the waves are concealed and for this reason it looks as though the many suns mirrored in the many waves were but one continuous sun and the shadows mixed up with the luminous images render this radiance less brilliant than that of the sun mirrored in these waves footnote in the original at letter a in the diagram sole the sun is written and at o occhio the eye this will have before it the treatise on light and shade the edges in the moon will be most strongly lighted and reflect most light because there nothing will be visible but the tops of the waves of the water footnote i have thought it unnecessary to reproduce the detailed explanation of the theory of reflection on waves contained in the passage which follows this the sun will appear larger in moving water or on waves than in still water an example is the light reflected on the strings of a monochord ii the sun the question of the true and of the apparent size of the sun in praise of the sun if you look at the stars cutting off the rays as may be done by looking through a very small hole made with the extreme point of a very fine needle placed so as almost to touch the eye you will see those stars so minute that it would seem as though nothing could be smaller it is in fact their great distance which is the reason of their diminution for many of them are very many times larger than the star which is the earth with water now reflect what this our star must look like at such a distance and then consider how many stars might be added both in longitude and latitude between those stars which are scattered over the darkened sky but i cannot forbear to condemn many of the ancients who said that the sun was no larger than it appears among these was epicurus and i believe that he founded his reason on the effects of a light placed in our atmosphere equidistant from the centre of the earth any one looking at it never sees it diminished in size at whatever distance and the rea footnote what leonardo says of epicurus who according to lewis the astronomy of the ancients and madler geschichte der himmelskunde did not devote much attention to the study of celestial phenomena he probably derived from book x of diogenes laertius whose vitae philosophorum was not printed in greek till but the latin translation appeared in sons of its size and power i shall reserve for book but i wonder greatly that socrates footnote socrates i have little light to throw on this reference plato s socrates himself declares on more than one occasion that in his youth he had turned his mind to the study of celestial phenomena metewpa but not in his later years see g c lewis the astronomy of the ancients page madler geschichte der himmelskunde page here and there in plato s writings we find incidental notes on the sun and other heavenly bodies leonardo may very well have known of these since the latin version by ficinus was printed as early as indeed an undated edition exists which may very likely have appeared between there is but one passage in plato epinomis p where he speaks of the physical properties of the sun and says that it is larger than the earth aristotle who goes very fully into the subject says the same a complete edition of aristotele s works was first printed in venice but a latin version of the books de coelo et mundo and de physica had been printed in venice as early as in h muller strubing should have depreciated that solar body saying that it was of the nature of incandescent stone and the one who opposed him as to that error was not far wrong but i only wish i had words to serve me to blame those who are fain to extol the worship of men more than that of the sun for in the whole universe there is nowhere to be seen a body of greater magnitude and power than the sun its light gives light to all the celestial bodies which are distributed throughout the universe and from it descends all vital force for the heat that is in living beings comes from the soul vital spark and there is no other centre of heat and light in the universe as will be shown in book and certainly those who have chosen to worship men as gods as jove saturn mars and the like have fallen into the gravest error seeing that even if a man were as large as our earth he would look no bigger than a little star which appears but as a speck in the universe and seeing again that these men are mortal and putrid and corrupt in their sepulchres marcellus footnote i have no means of identifying marcello who is named in the margin it may be nonius marcellus an obscure roman grammarian of uncertain date between the iind and vth centuries a c the author of the treatise de compendiosa doctrina per litteras ad filium in which he treats de rebus omnibus et quibusdam aliis this was much read in the middle ages the editto princeps is dated h muller strubing and many others praise the sun epicurus perhaps saw the shadows cast by columns on the walls in front of them equal in diameter to the columns from which the shadows were cast and the breadth of the shadows being parallel from beginning to end he thought he might infer that the sun also was directly opposite to this parallel and that consequently its breadth was not greater than that of the column not perceiving that the diminution in the shadow was insensibly slight by reason of the remoteness of the sun if the sun were smaller than the earth the stars on a great portion of our hemisphere would have no light which is evidence against epicurus who says the sun is only as large as it appears footnote in the original the writing is across the diagram epicurus says the sun is the size it looks hence as it looks about a foot across we must consider that to be its size it would follow that when the moon eclipses the sun the sun ought not to appear the larger as it does then the moon being smaller than the sun the moon must be less than a foot and consequently when our world eclipses the moon it must be less than a foot by a finger s breadth inasmuch as if the sun is a foot across and our earth casts a conical shadow on the moon it is inevitable that the luminous cause of the cone of shadow must be larger than the opaque body which casts the cone of shadow to measure how many times the diameter of the sun will go into its course in hours make a circle and place it to face the south after the manner of a sundial and place a rod in the middle in such a way as that its length points to the centre of this circle and mark the shadow cast in the sunshine by this rod on the circumference of the circle and this shadow will be let us say as broad as from a to n now measure how many times this shadow will go into this circumference of a circle and that will give you the number of times that the solar body will go into its orbit in hours thus you may see whether epicurus was right in saying that the sun was only as large as it looked for as the apparent diameter of the sun is about a foot and as that sun would go a thousand times into the length of its course in hours it would have gone a thousand feet that is braccia which is the sixth of a mile whence it would follow that the course of the sun during the day would be the sixth part of a mile and that this venerable snail the sun will have travelled braccia an hour posidonius composed books on the size of the sun footnote poseidonius of apamea commonly called the rhodian because he taught in rhodes was a stoic philosopher a contemporary and friend of cicero s and the author of numerous works on natural science among them strabo quotes no doubt from one of his works when he says that poseidonius explained how it was that the sun looked larger when it was rising or setting than during the rest of its course iii p kleomedes a later greek naturalist also mentions this observation of poseidonius without naming the title of his work however as kleomedes cyclia theorica was not printed till leonardo must have derived his quotation from strabo he probably wrote this note in and as the original greek was first printed in venice in we must suppose him to quote here from the translation by guarinus veronensis which was printed as early as also at venice h muller strubing of the nature of sunlight of the proof that the sun is hot by nature and not by virtue of the nature of sunlight that the heat of the sun resides in its nature and not in its virtue or mode of action is abundantly proved by the radiance of the solar body on which the human eye cannot dwell and besides this no less manifestly by the rays reflected from a concave mirror which when they strike the eye with such splendour that the eye cannot bear them have a brilliancy equal to the sun in its own place and that this is true i prove by the fact that if the mirror has its concavity formed exactly as is requisite for the collecting and reflecting of these rays no created being could endure the heat that strikes from the reflected rays of such a mirror and if you argue that the mirror itself is cold and yet send forth hot rays i should reply that those rays come really from the sun and that it is the ray of the concave mirror after having passed through the window considerations as to the size of the sun the sun does not move footnote this sentence occurs incidentally among mathematical notes and is written in unusually large letters proof that the nearer you are to the source of the solar rays the larger will the reflection of the sun from the sea appear to you footnote lines and fol compare vol i nos if it is from the centre that the sun employs its radiance to intensify the power of its whole mass it is evident that the farther its rays extend the more widely they will be divided and this being so you whose eye is near the water that mirrors the sun see but a small portion of the rays of the sun strike the surface of the water and reflecting the form of the sun but if you were near to the sun as would be the case when the sun is on the meridian and the sea to the westward you would see the sun mirrored in the sea of a very great size because as you are nearer to the sun your eye taking in the rays nearer to the point of radiation takes more of them in and a great splendour is the result and in this way it can be proved that the moon must have seas which reflect the sun and that the parts which do not shine are land take the measure of the sun at the solstice in mid june why the sun appears larger when setting than at noon when it is near to us every object seen through a curved medium seems to be of larger size than it is footnote at a is written sole the sun at b terra the earth because the eye is small it can only see the image of the sun as of a small size if the eye were as large as the sun it would see the image of the sun in water of the same size as the real body of the sun so long as the water is smooth a method of seeing the sun eclipsed without pain to the eye take a piece of paper and pierce holes in it with a needle and look at the sun through these holes iii the moon on the luminousity of the moon of the moon as i propose to treat of the nature of the moon it is necessary that first i should describe the perspective of mirrors whether plane concave or convex and first what is meant by a luminous ray and how it is refracted by various kinds of media then when a reflected ray is most powerful whether when the angle of incidence is acute right or obtuse or from a convex a plane or a concave surface or from an opaque or a transparent body besides this how it is that the solar rays which fall on the waves of the sea are seen by the eye of the same width at the angle nearest to the eye as at the highest line of the waves on the horizon but notwithstanding this the solar rays reflected from the waves of the sea assume the pyramidal form and consequently at each degree of distance increase proportionally in size although to our sight they appear as parallel st nothing that has very little weight is opaque dly nothing that is excessively weighty can remain beneath that which is heavier dly as to whether the moon is situated in the centre of its elements or not and if it has no proper place of its own like the earth in the midst of its elements why does it not fall to the centre of our elements footnote the problem here propounded by leonardo was not satisfactorily answered till newton in formulated the law of universal attraction and gravitation compare no lines and if the moon is not in the centre of its own elements and yet does not fall it must then be lighter than any other element and if the moon is lighter than the other elements why is it opaque and not transparent when objects of various sizes being placed at various distances look of equal size there must be the same relative proportion in the distances as in the magnitudes of the objects footnote in the diagram leonardo wrote sole at the place marked a of the moon and whether it is polished and spherical the image of the sun in the moon is powerfully luminous and is only on a small portion of its surface and the proof may be seen by taking a ball of burnished gold and placing it in the dark with a light at some distance from it and then although it will illuminate about half of the ball the eye will perceive its reflection only in a small part of its surface and all the rest of the surface reflects the darkness which surrounds it so that it is only in that spot that the image of the light is seen and all the rest remains invisible the eye being at a distance from the ball the same thing would happen on the surface of the moon if it were polished lustrous and opaque like all bodies with a reflecting surface show how if you were standing on the moon or on a star our earth would seem to reflect the sun as the moon does and show that the image of the sun in the sea cannot appear one and undivided as it appears in a perfectly plane mirror how shadows are lost at great distances as is shown by the shadow side of the moon which is never seen footnote compare also vol i nos either the moon has intrinsic luminosity or not if it has why does it not shine without the aid of the sun but if it has not any light in itself it must of necessity be a spherical mirror and if it is a mirror is it not proved in perspective that the image of a luminous object will never be equal to the extent of surface of the reflecting body that it illuminates and if it be thus footnote at a in the diagram leonardo wrote sole the sun and at b luna o noi terra the moon or our earth compare also the text of no as is here shown at r s in the figure whence comes so great an extent of radiance as that of the full moon as we see it at the fifteenth day of the moon of the moon the moon has no light in itself but so much of it as faces the sun is illuminated and of that illumined portion we see so much as faces the earth and the moon s night receives just as much light as is lent it by our waters as they reflect the image of the sun which is mirrored in all those waters which are on the side towards the sun the outside or surface of the waters forming the seas of the moon and of the seas of our globe is always ruffled little or much or more or less and this roughness causes an extension of the numberless images of the sun which are repeated in the ridges and hollows the sides and fronts of the innumerable waves that is to say in as many different spots on each wave as our eyes find different positions to view them from this could not happen if the aqueous sphere which covers a great part of the moon were uniformly spherical for then the images of the sun would be one to each spectator and its reflections would be separate and independent and its radiance would always appear circular as is plainly to be seen in the gilt balls placed on the tops of high buildings but if those gilt balls were rugged or composed of several little balls like mulberries which are a black fruit composed of minute round globules then each portion of these little balls when seen in the sun would display to the eye the lustre resulting from the reflection of the sun and thus in one and the same body many tiny suns would be seen and these often combine at a long distance and appear as one the lustre of the new moon is brighter and stronger than when the moon is full and the reason of this is that the angle of incidence is more obtuse in the new than in the full moon in which the angles of incidence and reflection are highly acute the waves of the moon therefore mirror the sun in the hollows of the waves as well as on the ridges and the sides remain in shadow but at the sides of the moon the hollows of the waves do not catch the sunlight but only their crests and thus the images are fewer and more mixed up with the shadows in the hollows and this intermingling of the shaded and illuminated spots comes to the eye with a mitigated splendour so that the edges will be darker because the curves of the sides of the waves are insufficient to reflect to the eye the rays that fall upon them now the new moon naturally reflects the solar rays more directly towards the eye from the crests of the waves than from any other part as is shown by the form of the moon whose rays a strike the waves b and are reflected in the line b d the eye being situated at d this cannot happen at the full moon when the solar rays being in the west fall on the extreme waters of the moon to the east from n to m and are not reflected to the eye in the west but are thrown back eastwards with but slight deflection from the straight course of the solar ray and thus the angle of incidence is very wide indeed the moon is an opaque and solid body and if on the contrary it were transparent it would not receive the light of the sun the yellow or yolk of an egg remains in the middle of the albumen without moving on either side now it is either lighter or heavier than this albumen or equal to it if it is lighter it ought to rise above all the albumen and stop in contact with the shell of the egg and if it is heavier it ought to sink and if it is equal it might just as well be at one of the ends as in the middle or below footnote compare no the innumerable images of the solar rays reflected from the innumerable waves of the sea as they fall upon those waves are what cause us to see the very broad and continuous radiance on the surface of the sea that the sun could not be mirrored in the body of the moon which is a convex mirror in such a way as that so much of its surface as is illuminated by the sun should reflect the sun unless the moon had a surface adapted to reflect it in waves and ridges like the surface of the sea when its surface is moved by the wind footnote in the original diagrams sole is written at the place marked a luna at c and terra at the two spots marked b the waves in water multiply the image of the object reflected in it these waves reflect light each by its own line as the surface of the fir cone does footnote see the diagram p these are figures one different from the other one with undulating water and the other with smooth water it is impossible that at any distance the image of the sun cast on the surface of a spherical body should occupy the half of the sphere here you must prove that the earth produces all the same effects with regard to the moon as the moon with regard to the earth the moon with its reflected light does not shine like the sun because the light of the moon is not a continuous reflection of that of the sun on its whole surface but only on the crests and hollows of the waves of its waters and thus the sun being confusedly reflected from the admixture of the shadows that lie between the lustrous waves its light is not pure and clear as the sun is footnote this refers to the small diagram placed between b and b the earth between the moon on the fifteenth day and the sun footnote see the diagram below the one referred to in the preceding note here the sun is in the east and the moon on the fifteenth day in the west footnote refers to the diagram below the others the moon on the fifteenth day between the earth and the sun here it is the moon which has the sun to the west and the earth to the east what sort of thing the moon is the moon is not of itself luminous but is highly fitted to assimilate the character of light after the manner of a mirror or of water or of any other reflecting body and it grows larger in the east and in the west like the sun and the other planets and the reason is that every luminous body looks larger in proportion as it is remote it is easy to understand that every planet and star is farther from us when in the west than when it is overhead by about miles as is proved on the margin footnote refers to the first diagram a sole the sun b terra the earth c luna the moon and if you see the sun or moon mirrored in the water near to you it looks to you of the same size in the water as in the sky but if you recede to the distance of a mile it will look times larger and if you see the sun reflected in the sea at sunset its image would look to you more than miles long because that reflected image extends over more than miles of sea and if you could stand where the moon is the sun would look to you as if it were reflected from all the sea that it illuminates by day and the land amid the water would appear just like the dark spots that are on the moon which when looked at from our earth appears to men the same as our earth would appear to any men who might dwell in the moon footnote this text has already been published by libri histoire des sciences iii pp of the nature of the moon when the moon is entirely lighted up to our sight we see its full daylight and at that time owing to the reflection of the solar rays which fall on it and are thrown off towards us its ocean casts off less moisture towards us and the less light it gives the more injurious it is of the moon i say that as the moon has no light in itself and yet is luminous it is inevitable but that its light is caused by some other body of the moon all my opponent s arguments to say that there is no water in the moon footnote the objections are very minutely noted down in the manuscript but they hardly seem to have a place here answer to maestro andrea da imola who said that the solar rays reflected from a convex mirror are mingled and lost at a short distance whereby it is altogether denied that the luminous side of the moon is of the nature of a mirror and that consequently the light is not produced by the innumerable multitude of the waves of that sea which i declared to be the portion of the moon which is illuminated by the solar rays let o p be the body of the sun c n s the moon and b the eye which above the base c n of the cathetus c n m sees the body of the sun reflected at equal angles c n and the same again on moving the eye from b to a footnote the large diagram on the margin of page belongs to this chapter explanation of the lumen cinereum in the moon of the moon no solid body is less heavy than the atmosphere footnote on the margin are the words tola romantina tola ferro stagnato tinned iron romantina is some special kind of sheet iron no longer known by that name having proved that the part of the moon that shines consists of water which mirrors the body of the sun and reflects the radiance it receives from it and that if these waters were devoid of waves it would appear small but of a radiance almost like the sun it must now be shown whether the moon is a heavy or a light body for if it were a heavy body admitting that at every grade of distance from the earth greater levity must prevail so that water is lighter than the earth and air than water and fire than air and so on successively it would seem that if the moon had density as it really has it would have weight and having weight that it could not be sustained in the space where it is and consequently that it would fall towards the centre of the universe and become united to the earth or if not the moon itself at least its waters would fall away and be lost from it and descend towards the centre leaving the moon without any and so devoid of lustre but as this does not happen as might in reason be expected it is a manifest sign that the moon is surrounded by its own elements that is to say water air and fire and thus is of itself and by itself suspended in that part of space as our earth with its element is in this part of space and that heavy bodies act in the midst of its elements just as other heavy bodies do in ours footnote this passage would certainly seem to establish leonardo s claim to be regarded as the original discoverer of the cause of the ashy colour of the new moon lumen cinereum his observations however having hitherto remained unknown to astronomers moestlin and kepler have been credited with the discoveries which they made independently a century later some disconnected notes treat of the same subject in ms c a b b and b perche la luna cinta della parte alluminata dal sole in ponente tra maggior splendore in mezzo a tal cerchio che quando essa eclissava il sole questo accade perche nell eclissare il sole ella ombrava il nostro oceano il qual caso non accade essendo in ponente quando il sole alluma esso oceano the editors of the saggio who first published this passage page add another short one about the seasons in the moon which i confess not to have seen in the original manuscript la luna ha ogni mese un verno e una state e ha maggiori freddi e maggiori caldi e i suoi equinozii son piu freddi de nostri when the eye is in the east and sees the moon in the west near to the setting sun it sees it with its shaded portion surrounded by luminous portions and the lateral and upper portion of this light is derived from the sun and the lower portion from the ocean in the west which receives the solar rays and reflects them on the lower waters of the moon and indeed affords the part of the moon that is in shadow as much radiance as the moon gives the earth at midnight therefore it is not totally dark and hence some have believed that the moon must in parts have a light of its own besides that which is given it by the sun and this light is due as has been said to the above mentioned cause that our seas are illuminated by the sun again it might be said that the circle of radiance shown by the moon when it and the sun are both in the west is wholly borrowed from the sun when it and the sun and the eye are situated as is shown above footnote the larger of the two diagrams reproduced above stands between these two lines and the smaller one is sketched in the margin at the spot marked a leonardo wrote corpo solare solar body in the larger diagram and sole sun in the smaller one at c luna moon is written and at b terra the earth some might say that the air surrounding the moon as an element catches the light of the sun as our atmosphere does and that it is this which completes the luminous circle on the body of the moon some have thought that the moon has a light of its own but this opinion is false because they have founded it on that dim light seen between the hornes of the new moon which looks dark where it is close to the bright part while against the darkness of the background it looks so light that many have taken it to be a ring of new radiance completing the circle where the tips of the horns illuminated by the sun cease to shine footnote see pl cviii no and this difference of background arises from the fact that the portion of that background which is conterminous with the bright part of the moon by comparison with that brightness looks darker than it is while at the upper part where a portion of the luminous circle is to be seen of uniform width the result is that the moon being brighter there than the medium or background on which it is seen by comparison with that darkness it looks more luminous at that edge than it is and that brightness at such a time itself is derived from our ocean and other inland seas these are at that time illuminated by the sun which is already setting in such a way as that the sea then fulfils the same function to the dark side of the moon as the moon at its fifteenth day does to us when the sun is set and the small amount of light which the dark side of the moon receives bears the same proportion to the light of that side which is illuminated as that footnote here the text breaks off lines are written on the margin if you want to see how much brighter the shaded portion of the moon is than the background on which it is seen conceal the luminous portion of the moon with your hand or with some other more distant object on the spots in the moon the spots on the moon some have said that vapours rise from the moon after the manner of clouds and are interposed between the moon and our eyes but if this were the case these spots would never be permanent either as to position or form and seeing the moon from various aspects even if these spots did not move they would change in form as objects do which are seen from different sides of the spots on the moon others say that the moon is composed of more or less transparent parts as though one part were something like alabaster and others like crystal or glass it would follow from this that the sun casting its rays on the less transparent portions the light would remain on the surface and so the denser part would be illuminated and the transparent portions would display the shadow of their darker depths and this is their account of the structure and nature of the moon and this opinion has found favour with many philosophers and particularly with aristotle and yet it is a false view for in the various phases and frequent changes of the moon and sun to our eyes we should see these spots vary at one time looking dark and at another light they would be dark when the sun is in the west and the moon in the middle of the sky for then the transparent hollows would be in shadow as far as the tops of the edges of those transparent hollows because the sun could not then fling his rays into the mouth of the hollows which however at full moon would be seen in bright light at which time the moon is in the east and faces the sun in the west then the sun would illuminate even the lowest depths of these transparent places and thus as there would be no shadows cast the moon at these times would not show us the spots in question and so it would be now more and now less according to the changes in the position of the sun to the moon and of the moon to our eyes as i have said above of the spots on the moon it has been asserted that the spots on the moon result from the moon being of varying thinness or density but if this were so when there is an eclipse of the moon the solar rays would pierce through the portions which were thin as is alleged footnote eclissi this word as it seems to me here means eclipses of the sun and the sense of the passage as i understand it is that by the foregoing hypothesis the moon when it comes between the sun and the earth must appear as if pierced we may say like a sieve but as we do not see this effect the opinion must be false others say that the surface of the moon is smooth and polished and that like a mirror it reflects in itself the image of our earth this view is also false inasmuch as the land where it is not covered with water presents various aspects and forms hence when the moon is in the east it would reflect different spots from those it would show when it is above us or in the west now the spots on the moon as they are seen at full moon never vary in the course of its motion over our hemisphere a second reason is that an object reflected in a convex body takes up but a small portion of that body as is proved in perspective footnote come e provato this alludes to the accompanying diagram the third reason is that when the moon is full it only faces half the hemisphere of the illuminated earth on which only the ocean and other waters reflect bright light while the land makes spots on that brightness thus half of our earth would be seen girt round with the brightness of the sea lighted up by the sun and in the moon this reflection would be the smallest part of that moon fourthly a radiant body cannot be reflected from another equally radiant therefore the sea since it borrows its brightness from the sun as the moon does could not cause the earth to be reflected in it nor indeed could the body of the sun be seen reflected in it nor indeed any star opposite to it if you keep the details of the spots of the moon under observation you will often find great variation in them and this i myself have proved by drawing them and this is caused by the clouds that rise from the waters in the moon which come between the sun and those waters and by their shadow deprive these waters of the sun s rays thus those waters remain dark not being able to reflect the solar body how the spots on the moon must have varied from what they formerly were by reason of the course of its waters on the moon s halo of halos round the moon i have found that the circles which at night seem to surround the moon of various sizes and degrees of density are caused by various gradations in the densities of the vapours which exist at different altitudes between the moon and our eyes and of these halos the largest and least red is caused by the lowest of these vapours the second smaller one is higher up and looks redder because it is seen through two vapours and so on as they are higher they will appear smaller and redder because between the eye and them there is thicker vapour whence it is proved that where they are seen to be reddest the vapours are most dense on instruments for observing the moon if you want to prove why the moon appears larger than it is when it reaches the horizon take a lens which is highly convex on one surface and concave on the opposite and place the concave side next the eye and look at the object beyond the convex surface by this means you will have produced an exact imitation of the atmosphere included beneath the sphere of fire and outside that of water for this atmosphere is concave on the side next the earth and convex towards the fire construct glasses to see the moon magnified footnote see the introduction p fracastoro says in his work homocentres per dua specilla ocularla si quis perspiciat alteri altero superposito majora multo et propinquiora videbit omnia quin imo quaedam specilla ocularia fiunt tantae densitatis ut si per ea quis aut lunam aut aliud siderum spectet adeo propinqua illa iudicet ut ne turres ipsas excedant sect ii c and sect iii c i the stars on the light of the stars the stars are visible by night and not by day because we are eneath the dense atmosphere which is full of innumerable articles of moisture each of which independently when the ays of the sun fall upon it reflects a radiance and so these umberless bright particles conceal the stars and if it were not or this atmosphere the sky would always display the stars against ts darkness footnote see no which also refers to starlight whether the stars have their light from the sun or in themselves some say that they shine of themselves alledging that if venus nd mercury had not a light of their own when they come between ur eye and the sun they would darken so much of the sun as they ould cover from our eye but this is false for it is proved that dark object against a luminous body is enveloped and entirely oncealed by the lateral rays of the rest of that luminous body nd so remains invisible as may be seen when the sun is seen hrough the boughs of trees bare of their leaves at some distance he branches do not conceal any portion of the sun from our eye he same thing happens with the above mentioned planets which hough they have no light of their own do not as has been said onceal any part of the sun from our eye second argument some say that the stars appear most brilliant at night in proportion as they are higher up and that if they had no light of their own the shadow of the earth which comes between them and the sun would darken them since they would not face nor be faced by the solar body but those persons have not considered that the conical shadow of the earth cannot reach many of the stars and even as to those it does reach the cone is so much diminished that it covers very little of the star s mass and all the rest is illuminated by the sun footnote from this and other remarks see no it is clear hat leonardo was familiar with the phenomena of irradiation why the planets appear larger in the east than they do overhead whereas the contrary should be the case as they are miles nearer to us when in mid sky than when on the horizon all the degrees of the elements through which the images of the celestial bodies pass to reach the eye are equal curves and the angles by which the central line of those images passes through them are unequal angles footnote inequali here and elsewhere does not mean unequal in the sense of not being equal to each other but angles which are not right angles and the distance is greater as is shown by the excess of a b beyond a d and the enlargement of these celestial bodies on the horizon is shown by the th of the th observations on the stars to see the real nature of the planets open the covering and note at the base footnote basa this probably alludes to some instrument perhaps the camera obscura one single planet and the reflected movement of this base will show the nature of the said planet but arrange that the base may face only one at the time on history of astronomy cicero says in his book de divinatione that astrology has been practised five hundred seventy thousand years before the trojan war footnote the statement that cicero de divin ascribes the discovery of astrology to a period years before the trojan war i believe to be quite erroneous according to ernesti clavis ciceroniana ch g schulz lexic cicer and the edition of de divin by giese the word astrologia occurs only twice in cicero de divin ii ad chaldaeorum monstra veniamus de quibus eudoxus platonis auditor in astrologia judicio doctissimorum hominum facile princeps sic opinatur id quod scriptum reliquit chaldaeis in praedictione et in notatione cujusque vitae ex natali die minime esse credendum he then quotes the condemnatory verdict of other philosophers as to the teaching of the chaldaeans but says nothing as to the antiquity and origin of astronomy cicero further notes de oratore i that aratus was ignarus astrologiae but that is all so far as i know the word occurs nowhere else in cicero and the word astronomia he does not seem to have used at all h muller strubing of time and its divisions although time is included in the class of continuous quantities being indivisible and immaterial it does not come entirely under the head of geometry which represents its divisions by means of figures and bodies of infinite variety such as are seen to be continuous in their visible and material properties but only with its first principles does it agree that is with the point and the line the point may be compared to an instant of time and the line may be likened to the length of a certain quantity of time and just as a line begins and terminates in a point so such a space of time begins and terminates in an instant and whereas a line is infinitely divisible the divisibility of a space of time is of the same nature and as the divisions of the line may bear a certain proportion to each other so may the divisions of time footnote this passage is repeated word for word on page b of the same manuscript and this is accounted for by the text in vol i no compare also no describe the nature of time as distinguished from the geometrical definitions divide an hour into parts and this you can do with a clock by making the pendulum lighter or heavier xvi physical geography leonardo s researches as to the structure of the earth and sea were made at a time when the extended voyages of the spaniards and portuguese had also excited a special interest in geographical questions in italy and particularly in tuscany still it need scarcely surprise us to find that in deeper questions as to the structure of the globe the primitive state of the earth s surface and the like he was far in advance of his time the number of passages which treat of such matters is relatively considerable like almost all leonardo s scientific notes they deal partly with theoretical and partly with practical questions some of his theoretical views of the motion of water were collected in a copied manuscript volume by an early transcriber but without any acknowledgment of the source whence they were derived this copy is now in the library of the barberini palace at rome and was published under the title de moto e misura dell acqua by francesco cardinali bologna in this work the texts are arranged under the following titles libr i della spera dell acqua libr ii del moto dell acqua libr iii dell onda dell acqua libr iv dei retrosi d acqua libr v dell acqua cadente libr vi delle rotture fatte dall acqua libr vii delle cose portate dall acqua libr viii dell oncia dell acqua e delle canne libr ix de molini e d altri ordigni d acqua the large number of isolated observations scattered through the manuscripts accounts for our so frequently finding notes of new schemes for the arrangement of those relating to water and its motions particularly in the codex atlanticus i have printed several of these plans as an introduction to the physical geography and i have actually arranged the texts in accordance with the clue afforded by one of them which is undoubtedly one of the latest notes referring to the subject no the text given as no which is also taken from a late note book of leonardo s served as a basis for the arrangement of the first of the seven books or sections bearing the title of the nature of water dell acque in se as i have not made it any part of this undertaking to print the passages which refer to purely physical principles it has also been necessary to exclude those practical researches which in accordance with indications given in ought to come in as books and i can only incidentally mention here that leonardo as it seems to me especially in his youth devoted a great deal of attention to the construction of mills this is proved by a number of drawings of very careful and minute execution which are to be found in the codex atlanticus nor was it possible to include his considerations on the regulation of rivers the making of canals and so forth no books and but those passages in which the structure of a canal is directly connected with notices of particular places will be found duly inserted under section xvii topographical notes in vol i no the text refers to canal making in general on one point only can the collection of passages included under the general heading of physical geography claim to be complete when comparing and sorting the materials for this work i took particular care not to exclude or omit any text in which a geographical name was mentioned even incidentally since in all such researches the chief interest as it appeared to me attached to the question whether these acute observations on the various local characteristics of mountains rivers or seas had been made by leonardo himself and on the spot it is self evident that the few general and somewhat superficial observations on the rhine and the danube on england and flanders must have been obtained from maps or from some informants and in the case of flanders leonardo himself acknowledges this see no but that most of the other and more exact observations were made on the spot by leonardo himself may be safely assumed from their method and the style in which he writes of them and we should bear it in mind that in all investigations of whatever kind experience is always spoken of as the only basis on which he relies incidentally as in no he thinks it necessary to allude to the total absence of all

man has been called the world in miniature and certainly this name is well bestowed because inasmuch as man is composed of earth water air and fire his body resembles that of the earth and as man has in him bones the supports and framework of his flesh the world has its rocks the supports of the earth as man has in him a pool of blood in which the lungs rise and fall in breathing so the body of the earth has its ocean tide which likewise rises and falls every six hours as if the world breathed as in that pool of blood veins have their origin which ramify all over the human body so likewise the ocean sea fills the body of the earth with infinite springs of water the body of the earth lacks sinews and this is because the sinews are made expressely for movements and the world being perpetually stable no movement takes place and no movement taking place muscles are not necessary but in all other points they are much alike i of the nature of water the arrangement of book i the order of the first book on water define first what is meant by height and depth also how the elements are situated one inside another then what is meant by solid weight and by liquid weight but first what weight and lightness are in themselves then describe why water moves and why its motion ceases then why it becomes slower or more rapid besides this how it always falls being in contact with the air but lower than the air and how water rises in the air by means of the heat of the sun and then falls again in rain again why water springs forth from the tops of mountains and if the water of any spring higher than the ocean can pour forth water higher than the surface of that ocean and how all the water that returns to the ocean is higher than the sphere of waters and how the waters of the equatorial seas are higher than the waters of the north and higher beneath the body of the sun than in any part of the equatorial circle for experiment shows that under the heat of a burning brand the water near the brand boils and the water surrounding this ebullition always sinks with a circular eddy and how the waters of the north are lower than the other seas and more so as they become colder until they are converted into ice definitions of what is water among the four elements water is the second both in weight and in instability the beginning of the book on water sea is the name given to that water which is wide and deep in which the waters have not much motion footnote only the beginning of this passage is here given the remainder consists of definitions which have no direct bearing on the subject of the surface of the water in relation to the globe the centres of the sphere of water are two one universal and common to all water the other particular the universal one is that which is common to all waters not in motion which exist in great quantities as canals ditches ponds fountains wells dead rivers lakes stagnant pools and seas which although they are at various levels have each in itself the limits of their superficies equally distant from the centre of the earth such as lakes placed at the tops of high mountains as the lake near pietra pana and the lake of the sybil near norcia and all the lakes that give rise to great rivers as the ticino from lago maggiore the adda from the lake of como the mincio from the lake of garda the rhine from the lakes of constance and of chur and from the lake of lucerne like the tigris which passes through asia minor carrying with it the waters of three lakes one above the other at different heights of which the highest is munace the middle one pallas and the lowest triton the nile again flows from three very high lakes in ethiopia footnote pietra pana a mountain near florence if for norcia we may read norchia the remains of the etruscan city near viterbo there can be no doubt that by lago della sibilla a name not known elsewhere so far as i can learn leonardo meant lago di vico lacus ciminus aen of the centre of the ocean the centre of the sphere of waters is the true centre of the globe of our world which is composed of water and earth having the shape of a sphere but if you want to find the centre of the element of the earth this is placed at a point equidistant from the surface of the ocean and not equidistant from the surface of the earth for it is evident that this globe of earth has nowhere any perfect rotundity excepting in places where the sea is or marshes or other still waters and every part of the earth that rises above the water is farther from the centre of the sea which changes the weight of the earth the shells oysters and other similar animals which originate in sea mud bear witness to the changes of the earth round the centre of our elements this is proved thus great rivers always run turbid being coloured by the earth which is stirred by the friction of their waters at the bottom and on their shores and this wearing disturbs the face of the strata made by the layers of shells which lie on the surface of the marine mud and which were produced there when the salt waters covered them and these strata were covered over again from time to time with mud of various thickness or carried down to the sea by the rivers and floods of more or less extent and thus these layers of mud became raised to such a height that they came up from the bottom to the air at the present time these bottoms are so high that they form hills or high mountains and the rivers which wear away the sides of these mountains uncover the strata of these shells and thus the softened side of the earth continually rises and the antipodes sink closer to the centre of the earth and the ancient bottoms of the seas have become mountain ridges let the earth make whatever changes it may in its weight the surface of the sphere of waters can never vary in its equal distance from the centre of the world of the proportion of the mass of water to that of the earth whether the earth is less than the water some assert that it is true that the earth which is not covered by water is much less than that covered by water but considering the size of miles in diameter which is that of this earth we may conclude the water to be of small depth of the earth the great elevations of the peaks of the mountains above the sphere of the water may have resulted from this that a very large portion of the earth which was filled with water that is to say the vast cavern inside the earth may have fallen in a vast part of its vault towards the centre of the earth being pierced by means of the course of the springs which continually wear away the place where they pass sinking in of countries like the dead sea in syria that is sodom and gomorrah it is of necessity that there should be more water than land and the visible portion of the sea does not show this so that there must be a great deal of water inside the earth besides that which rises into the lower air and which flows through rivers and springs footnote the small sketch below on the left is placed in the original close to the text referring to the dead sea the theory of plato the figures of the elements of the figures of the elements and first as against those who deny the opinions of plato and who say that if the elements include one another in the forms attributed to them by plato they would cause a vacuum one within the other i say it is not true and i here prove it but first i desire to propound some conclusions it is not necessary that the elements which include each other should be of corresponding magnitude in all the parts of that which includes and of that which is included we see that the sphere of the waters varies conspicuously in mass from the surface to the bottom and that far from investing the earth when that was in the form of a cube that is of angles as plato will have it that it invests the earth which has innumerable angles of rock covered by the water and various prominences and concavities and yet no vacuum is generated between the earth and water again the air invests the sphere of waters together with the mountains and valleys which rise above that sphere and no vacuum remains between the earth and the air so that any one who says a vacuum is generated speaks foolishly but to plato i would reply that the surface of the figures which according to him the elements would have could not exist that the flow of rivers proves the slope of the land proves how the earth is not globular and not being globular cannot have a common centre we see the nile come from southern regions and traverse various provinces running towards the north for a distance of miles and flow into the mediterranean by the shores of egypt and if we will give to this a fall of ten braccia a mile as is usually allowed to the course of rivers in general we shall find that the nile must have its mouth ten miles lower than its source again we see the rhine the rhone and the danube starting from the german parts almost the centre of europe and having a course one to the east the other to the north and the last to southern seas and if you consider all this you will see that the plains of europe in their aggregate are much higher than the high peaks of the maritime mountains think then how much their tops must be above the sea shores theory of the elevation of water within the mountains of the heat that is in the world where there is life there is heat and where vital heat is there is movement of vapour this is proved inasmuch as we see that the element of fire by its heat always draws to itself damp vapours and thick mists as opaque clouds which it raises from seas as well as lakes and rivers and damp valleys and these being drawn by degrees as far as the cold region the first portion stops because heat and moisture cannot exist with cold and dryness and where the first portion stops the rest settle and thus one portion after another being added thick and dark clouds are formed they are often wafted about and borne by the winds from one region to another where by their density they become so heavy that they fall in thick rain and if the heat of the sun is added to the power of the element of fire the clouds are drawn up higher still and find a greater degree of cold in which they form ice and fall in storms of hail now the same heat which holds up so great a weight of water as is seen to rain from the clouds draws them from below upwards from the foot of the mountains and leads and holds them within the summits of the mountains and these finding some fissure issue continuously and cause rivers the relative height of the surface of the sea to that of the land of the sea which to many fools appears to be higher than the earth which forms its shore b d is a plain through which a river flows to the sea this plain ends at the sea and since in fact the dry land that is uncovered is not perfectly level for if it were the river would have no motion as the river does move this place is a slope rather than a plain hence this plain d b so ends where the sphere of water begins that if it were extended in a continuous line to b a it would go down beneath the sea whence it follows that the sea a c b looks higher than the dry land obviously no portions of dry land left uncovered by water can ever be lower than the surface of the watery sphere of certain persons who say the waters were higher than the dry land certainly i wonder not a little at the common opinion which is contrary to truth but held by the universal consent of the judgment of men and this is that all are agreed that the surface of the sea is higher than the highest peaks of the mountains and they allege many vain and childish reasons against which i will allege only one simple and short reason we see plainly that if we could remove the shores of the sea it would invest the whole earth and make it a perfect sphere now consider how much earth would be carried away to enable the waves of the sea to cover the world therefore that which would be carried away must be higher than the sea shore the opinion of some persons who say that the water of some seas is higher than the highest summits of mountains and nevertheless the water was forced up to these summits water would not move from place to place if it were not that it seeks the lowest level and by a natural consequence it never can return to a height like that of the place where it first on issuing from the mountain came to light and that portion of the sea which in your vain imagining you say was so high that it flowed over the summits of the high mountains for so many centuries would be swallowed up and poured out again through the issue from these mountains you can well imagine that all the time that tigris and euphrates have flowed from the summits of the mountains of armenia it must be believed that all the water of the ocean has passed very many times through these mouths and do you not believe that the nile must have sent more water into the sea than at present exists of all the element of water undoubtedly yes and if all this water had fallen away from this body of the earth this terrestrial machine would long since have been without water whence we may conclude that the water goes from the rivers to the sea and from the sea to the rivers thus constantly circulating and returning and that all the sea and the rivers have passed through the mouth of the nile an infinite number of times footnote moti armeni ermini in the original in m ravaisson s

y en a a present dans tout l element de l eau il est certain que si cette eau etait tombee c ii on the ocean refutation of pliny s theory as to the saltness of the sea why water is salt pliny says in his second book chapter that the water of the sea is salt because the heat of the sun dries up the moisture and drinks it up and this gives to the wide stretching sea the savour of salt but this cannot be admitted because if the saltness of the sea were caused by the heat of the sun there can be no doubt that lakes pools and marshes would be so much the more salt as their waters have less motion and are of less depth but experience shows us on the contrary that these lakes have their waters quite free from salt again it is stated by pliny in the same chapter that this saltness might originate because all the sweet and subtle portions which the heat attracts easily being taken away the more bitter and coarser part will remain and thus the water on the surface is fresher than at the bottom footnote compare no but this is contradicted by the same reason given above which is that the same thing would happen in marshes and other waters which are dried up by the heat again it has been said that the saltness of the sea is the sweat of the earth to this it may be answered that all the springs of water which penetrate through the earth would then be salt but the conclusion is that the saltness of the sea must proceed from the many springs of water which as they penetrate into the earth find mines of salt and these they dissolve in part and carry with them to the ocean and the other seas whence the clouds the begetters of rivers never carry it up and the sea would be salter in our times than ever it was at any time and if the adversary were to say that in infinite time the sea would dry up or congeal into salt to this i answer that this salt is restored to the earth by the setting free of that part of the earth which rises out of the sea with the salt it has acquired and the rivers return it to the earth under the sea footnote see pliny hist nat ii ciii c itaque solis ardore siccatur liquor et hoc esse masculum sidus accepimus torrens cuncta sorbensque cp

quaedam vero et dulces inter se supermeant alias for the third and last reason we will say that salt is in all created things and this we learn from water passed over the ashes and cinders of burnt things and the urine of every animal and the superfluities issuing from their bodies and the earth into which all things are converted by corruption but to put it better given that the world is everlasting it must be admitted that its population will also be eternal hence the human species has eternally been and would be consumers of salt and if all the mass of the earth were to be turned into salt it would not suffice for all human food footnote that is on the supposition that salt once consumed disappears for ever whence we are forced to admit either that the species of salt must be everlasting like the world or that it dies and is born again like the men who devour it but as experience teaches us that it does not die as is evident by fire which does not consume it and by water which becomes salt in proportion to the quantity dissolved in it and when it is evaporated the salt always remains in the original quantity it must pass through the bodies of men either in the urine or the sweat or other excretions where it is found again and as much salt is thus got rid of as is carried every year into towns therefore salt is dug in places where there is urine sea hogs and sea winds are salt we will say that the rains which penetrate the earth are what is under the foundations of cities with their inhabitants and are what restore through the internal passages of the earth the saltness taken from the sea and that the change in the place of the sea which has been over all the mountains caused it to be left there in the mines found in those mountains c the characteristics of sea water the waters of the salt sea are fresh at the greatest depths that the ocean does not penetrate under the earth the ocean does not penetrate under the earth and this we learn from the many and various springs of fresh water which in many parts of the ocean make their way up from the bottom to the surface the same thing is farther proved by wells dug beyond the distance of a mile from the said ocean which fill with fresh water and this happens because the fresh water is lighter than salt water and consequently more penetrating which weighs most water when frozen or when not frozen fresh water penetrates more against salt water than salt water against fresh water that fresh water penetrates more against salt water than salt water against fresh is proved by a thin cloth dry and old hanging with the two opposite ends equally low in the two different waters the surfaces of which are at an equal level and it will then be seen how much higher the fresh water will rise in this piece of linen than the salt by so much is the fresh lighter than the salt on the formation of gulfs all inland seas and the gulfs of those seas are made by rivers which flow into the sea here the reason is given of the effects produced by the waters in the above mentioned place all the lakes and all the gulfs of the sea and all inland seas are due to rivers which distribute their waters into them and from impediments in their downfall into the mediterranean which divides africa from europe and europe from asia by means of the nile and the don which pour their waters into it it is asked what impediment is great enough to stop the course of the waters which do not reach the ocean on the encroachments of the sea on the land and vice versa of waves a wave of the sea always breaks in front of its base and that portion of the crest will then be lowest which before was highest footnote the page of francesco di giorgio s trattato on which leonardo has written this remark contains some notes on the construction of dams harbours c that the shores of the sea constantly acquire more soil towards the middle of the sea that the rocks and promontories of the sea are constantly being ruined and worn away that the mediterranean seas will in time discover their bottom to the air and all that will be left will be the channel of the greatest river that enters it and this will run to the ocean and pour its waters into that with those of all the rivers that are its tributaries how the river po in a short time might dry up the adriatic sea in the same way as it has dried up a large part of lombardy the ebb and flow of the tide where there is a larger quantity of water there is a greater flow and ebb but the contrary in narrow waters look whether the sea is at its greatest flow when the moon is half way over our hemisphere on the meridian whether the flow and ebb are caused by the moon or the sun or are the breathing of this terrestrial machine that the flow and ebb are different in different countries and seas footnote allusion may here be made to the mythological explanation of the ebb and flow given in the edda utgardloki says to thor gylfaginning when thou wert drinking out of the horn and it seemed to thee that it was slow in emptying a wonder befell which i should not have believed possible the other end of the horn lay in the sea which thou sawest not but when thou shalt go to the sea thou shalt see how much thou hast drunk out of it and that men now call the ebb tide several passages in various manuscripts treat of the ebb and flow in collecting them i have been guided by the rule only to transcribe those which named some particular spot book of the meeting of rivers and their flow and ebb the cause is the same in the sea where it is caused by the straits of gibraltar and again it is caused by whirlpools of the flow and ebb all seas have their flow and ebb in the same period but they seem to vary because the days do not begin at the same time throughout the universe in such wise as that when it is midday in our hemisphere it is midnight in the opposite hemisphere and at the eastern boundary of the two hemispheres the night begins which follows on the day and at the western boundary of these hemispheres begins the day which follows the night from the opposite side hence it is to be inferred that the above mentioned swelling and diminution in the height of the seas although they take place in one and the same space of time are seen to vary from the above mentioned causes the waters are then withdrawn into the fissures which start from the depths of the sea and which ramify inside the body of the earth corresponding to the sources of rivers which are constantly taking from the bottom of the sea the water which has flowed into it a sea of water is incessantly being drawn off from the surface of the sea and if you should think that the moon rising at the eastern end of the mediterranean sea must there begin to attract to herself the waters of the sea it would follow that we must at once see the effect of it at the eastern end of that sea again as the mediterranean sea is about the eighth part of the circumference of the aqueous sphere being miles long while the flow and ebb only occur times in hours these results would not agree with the time of hours unless this mediterranean sea were six thousand miles in length because if such a superabundance of water had to pass through the straits of gibraltar in running behind the moon the rush of the water through that strait would be so great and would rise to such a height that beyond the straits it would for many miles rush so violently into the ocean as to cause floods and tremendous seething so that it would be impossible to pass through this agitated ocean would afterwards return the waters it had received with equal fury to the place they had come from so that no one ever could pass through those straits now experience shows that at every hour they are passed in safety but when the wind sets in the same direction as the current the strong ebb increases footnote in attempting to get out of the mediterranean vessels are sometimes detained for a considerable time not merely by the causes mentioned by leonardo but by the constant current flowing eastwards through the middle of the straits of gibraltar the sea does not raise the water that has issued from the straits but it checks them and this retards the tide then it makes up with furious haste for the time it has lost until the end of the ebb movement that the flow and ebb are not general for on the shore at genoa there is none at venice two braccia between england and flanders braccia that in the straits of sicily the current is very strong because all the waters from the rivers that flow into the adriatic pass there footnote a few more recent data may be given here to facilitate comparison in the adriatic the tide rises and feet at terracina in the english channel between calais and kent it rises from to feet in the straits of messina it rises no more than feet and that only in stormy weather but the current is all the stronger when leonardo accounts for this by the southward flow of all the italian rivers along the coasts the explanation is at least based on a correct observation namely that a steady current flows southwards along the coast of calabria and another northwards along the shores of sicily he seems to infer from the direction of the fust that the tide in the adriatic is caused by it in the west near to flanders the sea rises and decreases every hours about braccia and when the moon is in its favour but braccia is the general rule and this rule as it is evident cannot have the moon for its cause this variation in the increase and decrease of the sea every hours may arise from the damming up of the waters which are poured into the mediterranean by the quantity of rivers from africa asia and europe which flow into that sea and the waters which are given to it by those rivers it pours them to the ocean through the straits of gibraltar between abila and calpe footnote abila lat abyla gr now sierra ximiera near ceuta calpe lat calpe gr now gibraltar leonardo here uses the ancient names of the rocks which were known as the pillars of hercules that ocean extends to the island of england and others farther north and it becomes dammed up and kept high in various gulfs these being seas of which the surface is remote from the centre of the earth have acquired a weight which as it is greater than the force of the incoming waters which cause it gives this water an impetus in the contrary direction to that in which it came and it is borne back to meet the waters coming out of the straits and this it does most against the straits of gibraltar these so long as this goes on remain dammed up and all the water which is poured out meanwhile by the aforementioned rivers is pent up in the mediterranean and this might be assigned as the cause of its flow and ebb as is shown in the st of the th of my theory iii subterranean water courses theory of the circulation of the waters very large rivers flow under ground this is meant to represent the earth cut through in the middle showing the depths of the sea and of the earth the waters start from the bottom of the seas and ramifying through the earth they rise to the summits of the mountains flowing back by the rivers and returning to the sea observations in support of the hypothesis the waters circulate with constant motion from the utmost depths of the sea to the highest summits of the mountains not obeying the nature of heavy matter and in this case it acts as does the blood of animals which is always moving from the sea of the heart and flows to the top of their heads and here it is that veins burst as one may see when a vein bursts in the nose that all the blood from below rises to the level of the burst vein when the water rushes out of a burst vein in the earth it obeys the nature of other things heavier than the air whence it always seeks the lowest places these waters traverse the body of the earth with infinite ramifications footnote the greater part of this passage has been given as no in the section on anatomy the same cause which stirs the humours in every species of animal body and by which every injury is repaired also moves the waters from the utmost depth of the sea to the greatest heights it is the property of water that it constitutes the vital human of this arid earth and the cause which moves it through its ramified veins against the natural course of heavy matters is the same property which moves the humours in every species of animal body but that which crowns our wonder in contemplating it is that it rises from the utmost depths of the sea to the highest tops of the mountains and flowing from the opened veins returns to the low seas then once more and with extreme swiftness it mounts again and returns by the same descent thus rising from the inside to the outside and going round from the lowest to the highest from whence it rushes down in a natural course thus by these two movements combined in a constant circulation it travels through the veins of the earth whether water rises from the sea to the tops of mountains the water of the ocean cannot make its way from the bases to the tops of the mountains which bound it but only so much rises as the dryness of the mountain attracts and if on the contrary the rain which penetrates from the summit of the mountain to the base which is the boundary of the sea descends and softens the slope opposite to the said mountain and constantly draws the water like a syphon footnote cicognola syphon see vol i pl xxiv no which pours through its longest side it must be this which draws up the water of the sea thus if s n were the surface of the sea and the rain descends from the top of the mountain a to n on one side and on the other sides it descends from a to m without a doubt this would occur after the manner of distilling through felt or as happens through the tubes called syphons footnote cicognola syphon see vol i pl xxiv no and at all times the water which has softened the mountain by the great rain which runs down the two opposite sides would constantly attract the rain a n on its longest side together with the water from the sea if that side of the mountain a m were longer than the other a n but this cannot be because no part of the earth which is not submerged by the ocean can be lower than that ocean of springs of water on the tops of mountains it is quite evident that the whole surface of the ocean when there is no storm is at an equal distance from the centre of the earth and that the tops of the mountains are farther from this centre in proportion as they rise above the surface of that sea therefore if the body of the earth were not like that of man it would be impossible that the waters of the sea being so much lower than the mountains could by their nature rise up to the summits of these mountains hence it is to be believed that the same cause which keeps the blood at the top of the head in man keeps the water at the summits of the mountains footnote this conception of the rising of the blood which has given rise to the comparison was recognised as erroneous by leonardo himself at a later period it must be remembered that the ms a from which these passages are taken was written about twenty years earlier than the ms leic nos and and twenty five years before the ms w an iv there is in the original a sketch with no which is not reproduced it represents a hill of the same shape as that shown at no there are veins or branched streams on the side of the hill like those on the skull pl cviii no in confirmation of why the water goes to the tops of mountains i say that just as the natural heat of the blood in the veins keeps it in the head of man for when the man is dead the cold blood sinks to the lower parts and when the sun is hot on the head of a man the blood increases and rises so much with other humours that by pressure in the veins pains in the head are often caused in the same way veins ramify through the body of the earth and by the natural heat which is distributed throughout the containing body the water is raised through the veins to the tops of mountains and this water which passes through a closed conduit inside the body of the mountain like a dead thing cannot come forth from its low place unless it is warmed by the vital heat of the spring time again the heat of the element of fire and by day the heat of the sun have power to draw forth the moisture of the low parts of the mountains and to draw them up in the same way as it draws the clouds and collects their moisture from the bed of the sea that many springs of salt water are found at great distances from the sea this might happen because such springs pass through some mine of salt like that in hungary where salt is hewn out of vast caverns just as stone is hewn footnote the great mine of wieliczka in galicia out of which a million cwt of rock salt are annually dug out extends for metres from west to east and metres from north to south iv of rivers on the way in which the sources of rivers are fed of the origin of rivers the body of the earth like the bodies of animals is intersected with ramifications of waters which are all in connection and are constituted to give nutriment and life to the earth and to its creatures these come from the depth of the sea and after many revolutions have to return to it by the rivers created by the bursting of these springs and if you chose to say that the rains of the winter or the melting of the snows in summer were the cause of the birth of rivers i could mention the rivers which originate in the torrid countries of africa where it never rains and still less snows because the intense heat always melts into air all the clouds which are borne thither by the winds and if you chose to say that such rivers as increase in july and august come from the snows which melt in may and june from the sun s approach to the snows on the mountains of scythia footnote scythia means here as in ancient geography the whole of the northern part of asia as far as india and that such meltings come down into certain valleys and form lakes into which they enter by springs and subterranean caves to issue forth again at the sources of the nile this is false because scythia is lower than the sources of the nile and besides scythia is only miles from the black sea and the sources of the nile are miles distant from the sea of egypt into which its waters flow the tide in estuaries book of the meeting of rivers and of their ebb and flow the cause is the same in the sea where it is caused by the straits of gibraltar and again it is caused by whirlpools if two rivers meet together to form a straight line and then below two right angles take their course together the flow and ebb will happen now in one river and now in the other above their confluence and principally if the outlet for their united volume is no swifter than when they were separate here occur instances footnote the first two lines of this passage have already been given as no in the margin near line of this passage the text given as no is written on the alterations caused in the courses of rivers by their confluence when a smaller river pours its waters into a larger one and that larger one flows from the opposite direction the course of the smaller river will bend up against the approach of the larger river and this happens because when the larger river fills up all its bed with water it makes an eddy in front of the mouth of the other river and so carries the water poured in by the smaller river with its own when the smaller river pours its waters into the larger one which runs across the current at the mouth of the smaller river its waters will bend with the downward movement of the larger river footnote in the original sketches the word arno is written at the spot here marked a at r rifredi and at m mugnone when the fulness of rivers is diminished then the acute angles formed at the junction of their branches become shorter at the sides and wider at the point like the current a n and the current d n which unite in n when the river is at its greatest fulness i say that when it is in this condition if before the fullest time d n was lower than a n at the time of fulness d n will be full of sand and mud when the water d n falls it will carry away the mud and remain with a lower bottom and the channel a n finding itself the higher will fling its waters into the lower d n and will wash away all the point of the sand spit b n c and thus the angle a c d will remain larger than the angle a n d and the sides shorter as i said before footnote above the first sketch we find in the original this note sopra il pote rubaconte alla torricella and by the second which represents a pier of a bridge sotto l ospedal del ceppo water of the movement of a sudden rush made by a river in its bed previously dry in proportion as the current of the water given forth by the draining of the lake is slow or rapid in the dry river bed so will this river be wider or narrower or shallower or deeper in one place than another according to this proposition the flow and ebb of the sea which enters the mediterranean from the ocean and of the rivers which meet and struggle with it will raise their waters more or less in proportion as the sea is wider or narrower footnote in the margin is a sketch of a river which winds so as to form islands whirlpools whirlpools that is to say caverns that is to say places left by precipitated waters on the alterations in the channels of rivers of the vibration of the earth the subterranean channels of waters like those which exist between the air and the earth are those which unceasingly wear away and deepen the beds of their currents the origin of the sand in rivers a river that flows from mountains deposits a great quantity of large stones in its bed which still have some of their angles and sides and in the course of its flow it carries down smaller stones with the angles more worn that is to say the large stones become smaller and farther on it deposits coarse gravel and then smaller and as it proceeds this becomes coarse sand and then finer and going on thus the water turbid with sand and gravel joins the sea and the sand settles on the sea shores being cast up by the salt waves and there results the sand of so fine a nature as to seem almost like water and it will not stop on the shores of the sea but returns by reason of its lightness because it was originally formed of rotten leaves and other very light things still being almost as was said of the nature of water itself it afterwards when the weather is calm settles and becomes solid at the bottom of the sea where by its fineness it becomes compact and by its smoothness resists the waves which glide over it and in this shells are found and this is white earth fit for pottery all the torrents of water flowing from the mountains to the sea carry with them the stones from the hills to the sea and by the influx of the sea water towards the mountains these stones were thrown back towards the mountains and as the waters rose and retired the stones were tossed about by it and in rolling their angles hit together then as the parts which least resisted the blows were worn off the stones ceased to be angular and became round in form as may be seen on the banks of the elsa and those remained larger which were less removed from their native spot and they became smaller the farther they were carried from that place so that in the process they were converted into small pebbles and then into sand and at last into mud after the sea had receded from the mountains the brine left by the sea with other humours of the earth made a concretion of these pebbles and this sand so that the pebbles were converted into rock and the sand into tufa and of this we see an example in the adda where it issues from the mountains of como and in the ticino the adige and the oglio coming from the german alps and in the arno at monte albano footnote at the foot of monte albano lies vinci the birth place of leonardo opposite on the other bank of the arno is monte lupo near monte lupo and capraia where the rocks which are very large are all of conglomerated pebbles of various kinds and colours v on mountains the formation of mountains mountains are made by the currents of rivers mountains are destroyed by the currents of rivers footnote compare that the northern bases of some alps are not yet petrified and this is plainly to be seen where the rivers which cut through them flow towards the north where they cut through the strata in the living stone in the higher parts of the mountains and where they join the plains these strata are all of potter s clay as is to be seen in the valley of lamona where the river lamona as it issues from the appenines does these things on its banks that the rivers have all cut and divided the mountains of the great alps one from the other this is visible in the order of the stratified rocks because from the summits of the banks down to the river the correspondence of the strata in the rocks is visible on either side of the river that the stratified stones of the mountains are all layers of clay deposited one above the other by the various floods of the rivers that the different size of the strata is caused by the difference in the floods that is to say greater or lesser floods the summits of mountains for a long time rise constantly the opposite sides of the mountains always approach each other below the depths of the valleys which are above the sphere of the waters are in the course of time constantly getting nearer to the centre of the world in an equal period the valleys sink much more than the mountains rise the bases of the mountains always come closer together in proportion as the valleys become deeper the more quickly are their sides worn away in every concavity at the summit of the mountains we shall always find the divisions of the strata in the rocks of the sea which encircles the earth i find that of old the state of the earth was that its plains were all covered up and hidden by salt water footnote this passage has already been published by dr m jordan das malerbuch des l da vinci leipzig p however his reading of the text differs from mine the authorities for the study of the structure of the earth since things are much more ancient than letters it is no marvel if in our day no records exist of these seas having covered so many countries and if moreover some records had existed war and conflagrations the deluge of waters the changes of languages and of laws have consumed every thing ancient but sufficient for us is the testimony of things created in the salt waters and found again in high mountains far from the seas vi geological problems in this work you have first to prove that the shells at a thousand braccia of elevation were not carried there by the deluge because they are seen to be all at one level and many mountains are seen to be above that level and to inquire whether the deluge was caused by rain or by the swelling of the sea and then you must show how neither by rain nor by swelling of the rivers nor by the overflow of this sea could the shells being heavy objects be floated up the mountains by the sea nor have carried there by the rivers against the course of their waters doubts about the deluge a doubtful point here a doubt arises and that is whether the deluge which happened at the time of noah was universal or not and it would seem not for the reasons now to be given we have it in the bible that this deluge lasted days and nights of incessant and universal rain and that this rain rose to ten cubits above the highest mountains in the world and if it had been that the rain was universal it would have covered our globe which is spherical in form and this spherical surface is equally distant in every part from the centre of its sphere hence the sphere of the waters being under the same conditions it is impossible that the water upon it should move because water in itself does not move unless it falls therefore how could the waters of such a deluge depart if it is proved that it has no motion and if it departed how could it move unless it went upwards here then natural reasons are wanting hence to remove this doubt it is necessary to call in a miracle to aid us or else to say that all this water was evaporated by the heat of the sun footnote the passages here given from the ms leic have hitherto remained unknown some preliminary notes on the subject are to be found in ms f oa and ob but as compared with the fuller treatment here given they are it seems to me of secondary interest they contain nothing that is not repeated here more clearly and fully libri histoire des sciences mathematiques iii pages has printed the text of f a and b therefore it seemed desirable to give my reasons for not inserting it in this work that marine shells could not go up the mountains of the deluge and of marine shells if you were to say that the shells which are to be seen within the confines of italy now in our days far from the sea and at such heights had been brought there by the deluge which left them there i should answer that if you believe that this deluge rose cubits above the highest mountains as he who measured it has written these shells which always live near the sea shore should have been left on the mountains and not such a little way from the foot of the mountains nor all at one level nor in layers upon layers and if you were to say that these shells are desirous of remaining near to the margin of the sea and that as it rose in height the shells quitted their first home and followed the increase of the waters up to their highest level to this i answer that the cockle is an animal of not more rapid movement than the snail is out of water or even somewhat slower because it does not swim on the contrary it makes a furrow in the sand by means of its sides and in this furrow it will travel each day from to braccia therefore this creature with so slow a motion could not have travelled from the adriatic sea as far as monferrato in lombardy footnote monferrato di lombardia the range of hills of monferrato is in piedmont and casale di monferrato belonged in leonardo s time to the marchese di mantova which is miles distance in days which he has said who took account of the time and if you say that the waves carried them there by their gravity they could not move excepting at the bottom and if you will not grant me this confess at least that they would have to stay at the summits of the highest mountains in the lakes which are enclosed among the mountains like the lakes of lario or of como and il maggiore footnote lago di lario lacus larius was the name given by the romans to the lake of como it is evident that it is here a slip of the pen since the the words in the ms are come lago di lario o l magare e di como in the ms after line we come upon a digression treating of the weight of water this has here been omitted it is lines long and of fiesole and of perugia and others and if you should say that the shells were carried by the waves being empty and dead i say that where the dead went they were not far removed from the living for in these mountains living ones are found which are recognisable by the shells being in pairs and they are in a layer where there are no dead ones and a little higher up they are found where they were thrown by the waves all the dead ones with their shells separated near to where the rivers fell into the sea to a great depth like the arno which fell from the gonfolina near to monte lupo footnote monte lupo compare it is between empoli and florence where it left a deposit of gravel which may still be seen and which has agglomerated and of stones of various districts natures and colours and hardness making one single conglomerate and a little beyond the sandstone conglomerate a tufa has been formed where it turned towards castel florentino farther on the mud was deposited in which the shells lived and which rose in layers according to the levels at which the turbid arno flowed into that sea and from time to time the bottom of the sea was raised depositing these shells in layers as may be seen in the cutting at colle gonzoli laid open by the arno which is wearing away the base of it in which cutting the said layers of shells are very plainly to be seen in clay of a bluish colour and various marine objects are found there and if the earth of our hemisphere is indeed raised by so much higher than it used to be it must have become by so much lighter by the waters which it lost through the rift between gibraltar and ceuta and all the more the higher it rose because the weight of the waters which were thus lost would be added to the earth in the other hemisphere and if the shells had been carried by the muddy deluge they would have been mixed up and separated from each other amidst the mud and not in regular steps and layers as we see them now in our time the marine shells were not produced away from the sea as to those who say that shells existed for a long time and were born at a distance from the sea from the nature of the place and of the cycles which can influence a place to produce such creatures to them it may be answered such an influence could not place the animals all on one line except those of the same sort and age and not the old with the young nor some with an operculum and others without their operculum nor some broken and others whole nor some filled with sea sand and large and small fragments of other shells inside the whole shells which remained open nor the claws of crabs without the rest of their bodies nor the shells of other species stuck on to them like animals which have moved about on them since the traces of their track still remain on the outside after the manner of worms in the wood which they ate into nor would there be found among them the bones and teeth of fish which some call arrows and others serpents tongues nor would so many footnote i scilla argued against this hypothesis which was still accepted in his days see la vana speculazione napoli portions of various animals be found all together if they had not been thrown on the sea shore and the deluge cannot have carried them there because things that are heavier than water do not float on the water but these things could not be at so great a height if they had not been carried there by the water such a thing being impossible from their weight in places where the valleys have not been filled with salt sea water shells are never to be seen as is plainly visible in the great valley of the arno above gonfolina a rock formerly united to monte albano in the form of a very high bank which kept the river pent up in such a way that before it could flow into the sea which was afterwards at its foot it formed two great lakes of which the first was where we now see the city of florence together with prato and pistoia and monte albano it followed the rest of its bank as far as where serravalle now stands from the val d arno upwards as far as arezzo another lake was formed which discharged its waters into the former lake it was closed at about the spot where now we see girone and occupied the whole of that valley above for a distance of miles in length this valley received on its bottom all the soil brought down by the turbid waters and this is still to be seen at the foot of prato magno it there lies very high where the rivers have not worn it away across this land are to be seen the deep cuts of the rivers that have passed there falling from the great mountain of prato magno in these cuts there are no vestiges of any shells or of marine soil this lake was joined with that of perugia footnote see pi cxiii a great quantity of shells are to be seen where the rivers flow into the sea because on such shores the waters are not so salt owing to the admixture of the fresh water which is poured into it evidence of this is to be seen where of old the appenines poured their rivers into the adriatic sea for there in most places great quantities of shells are to be found among the mountains together with bluish marine clay and all the rocks which are torn off in such places are full of shells the same may be observed to have been done by the arno when it fell from the rock of gonfolina into the sea which was not so very far below for at that time it was higher than the top of san miniato al tedesco since at the highest summit of this the shores may be seen full of shells and oysters within its flanks the shells did not extend towards val di nievole because the fresh waters of the arno did not extend so far that the shells were not carried away from the sea by the deluge because the waters which came from the earth although they drew the sea towards the earth were those which struck its depths because the water which goes down from the earth has a stronger current than that of the sea and in consequence is more powerful and it enters beneath the sea water and stirs the depths and carries with it all sorts of movable objects which are to be found in the earth such as the above mentioned shells and other similar things and in proportion as the water which comes from the land is muddier than sea water it is stronger and heavier than this therefore i see no way of getting the said shells so far in land unless they had been born there if you were to tell me that the river loire footnote leonardo has written era instead of loera or loira perhaps under the mistaken idea that lo was an article which traverses france covers when the sea rises more than eighty miles of country because it is a district of vast plains and the sea rises about braccia and shells are found in this plain at the distance of miles from the sea here i answer that the flow and ebb in our mediterranean sea does not vary so much for at genoa it does not rise at all and at venice but little and very little in africa and where it varies little it covers but little of the country the course of the water of a river always rises higher in a place where the current is impeded it behaves as it does where it is reduced in width to pass under the arches of a bridge further researches a confutation of those who say that shells may have been carried to a distance of many days journey from the sea by the deluge which was so high as to be above those heights i say that the deluge could not carry objects native to the sea up to the mountains unless the sea had already increased so as to create inundations as high up as those places and this increase could not have occurred because it would cause a vacuum and if you were to say that the air would rush in there we have already concluded that what is heavy cannot remain above what is light whence of necessity we must conclude that this deluge was caused by rain water so that all these waters ran to the sea and the sea did not run up the mountains and as they ran to the sea they thrust the shells from the shore of the sea and did not draw them to wards themselves and if you were then to say that the sea raised by the rain water had carried these shells to such a height we have already said that things heavier than water cannot rise upon it but remain at the bottom of it and do not move unless by the impact of the waves and if you were to say that the waves had carried them to such high spots we have proved that the waves in a great depth move in a contrary direction at the bottom to the motion at the top and this is shown by the turbidity of the sea from the earth washed down near its shores anything which is lighter than the water moves with the waves and is left on the highest level of the highest margin of the waves anything which is heavier than the water moves suspended in it between the surface and the bottom and from these two conclusions which will be amply proved in their place we infer that the waves of the surface cannot convey shells since they are heavier than water if the deluge had to carry shells three hundred and four hundred miles from the sea it would have carried them mixed with various other natural objects heaped together and we see at such distances oysters all together and sea snails and cuttlefish and all the other shells which congregate together all to be found together and dead and the solitary shells are found wide apart from each other as we may see them on sea shores every day and if we find oysters of very large shells joined together and among them very many which still have the covering attached indicating that they were left here by the sea and still living when the strait of gibraltar was cut through there are to be seen in the mountains of parma and piacenza a multitude of shells and corals full of holes and still sticking to the rocks there when i was making the great horse for milan a large sack full was brought to me in my workshop by certain peasants these were found in that place and among them were many preserved in their first freshness under ground and under the foundations of buildings timbers are found of wrought beams and already black such were found in my time in those diggings at castel fiorentino and these had been in that deep place before the sand carried by the arno into the sea then covering the plain had heen raised to such a height and before the plains of casentino had been so much lowered by the earth being constantly carried down from them footnote these lines are written in the margin and if you were to say that these shells were created and were continually being created in such places by the nature of the spot and of the heavens which might have some influence there such an opinion cannot exist in a brain of much reason because here are the years of their growth numbered on their shells and there are large and small ones to be seen which could not have grown without food and could not have fed without motion and here they could not move footnote these lines are written in the margin that in the drifts among one and another there are still to be found the traces of the worms which crawled upon them when they were not yet dry and all marine clays still contain shells and the shells are petrified together with the clay from their firmness and unity some persons will have it that these animals were carried up to places remote from the sea by the deluge another sect of ignorant persons declare that nature or heaven created them in these places by celestial influences as if in these places we did not also find the bones of fishes which have taken a long time to grow and as if we could not count in the shells of cockles and snails the years and months of their life as we do in the horns of bulls and oxen and in the branches of plants that have never been cut in any part besides having proved by these signs the length of their lives it is evident and it must be admitted that these animals could not live without moving to fetch their food and we find in them no instrument for penetrating the earth or the rock where we find them enclosed but how could we find in a large snail shell the fragments and portions of many other sorts of shells of various sorts if they had not been thrown there when dead by the waves of the sea like the other light objects which it throws on the earth why do we find so many fragments and whole shells between layer and layer of stone if this had not formerly been covered on the shore by a layer of earth thrown up by the sea and which was afterwards petrified and if the deluge before mentioned had carried them to these parts of the sea you might find these shells at the boundary of one drift but not at the boundary between many drifts we must also account for the winters of the years during which the sea multiplied the drifts of sand and mud brought down by the neighbouring rivers by washing down the shores and if you chose to say that there were several deluges to produce these rifts and the shells among them you would also have to affirm that such a deluge took place every year again among the fragments of these shells it must be presumed that in those places there were sea coasts where all the shells were thrown up broken and divided and never in pairs since they are found alive in the sea with two valves each serving as a lid to the other and in the drifts of rivers and on the shores of the sea they are found in fragments and within the limits of the separate strata of rocks they are found few in number and in pairs like those which were left by the sea buried alive in the mud which subsequently dried up and in time was petrified and if you choose to say that it was the deluge which carried these shells away from the sea for hundreds of miles this cannot have happened since that deluge was caused by rain because rain naturally forces the rivers to rush towards the sea with all the things they carry with them and not to bear the dead things of the sea shores to the mountains and if you choose to say that the deluge afterwards rose with its waters above the mountains the movement of the sea must have been so sluggish in its rise against the currents of the rivers that it could not have carried floating upon it things heavier than itself and even if it had supported them in its receding it would have left them strewn about in various spots but how are we to account for the corals which are found every day towards monte ferrato in lombardy with the holes of the worms in them sticking to rocks left uncovered by the currents of rivers these rocks are all covered with stocks and families of oysters which as we know never move but always remain with one of their halves stuck to a rock and the other they open to feed themselves on the animalcules that swim in the water which hoping to find good feeding ground become the food of these shells we do not find that the sand mixed with seaweed has been petrified because the weed which was mingled with it has shrunk away and this the po shows us every day in the debris of its banks other problems why do we find the bones of great fishes and oysters and corals and various other shells and sea snails on the high summits of mountains by the sea just as we find them in low seas you now have to prove that the shells cannot have originated if not in salt water almost all being of that sort and that the shells in lombardy are at four levels and thus it is everywhere having been made at various times and they all occur in valleys that open towards the seas from the two lines of shells we are forced to say that the earth indignantly submerged under the sea and so the first layer was made and then the deluge made the second footnote this note is in the early writing of about on the same sheet are the passages no and compare also no all the foregoing chapters are from manuscripts of about this explains the want of connection and the contradiction between this and the foregoing texts vii on the atmosphere constituents of the atmosphere that the brightness of the air is occasioned by the water which has dissolved itself in it into imperceptible molecules these being lighted by the sun from the opposite side reflect the brightness which is visible in the air and the azure which is seen in it is caused by the darkness that is hidden beyond the air footnote compare vol i no on the motion of air that the return eddies of wind at the mouth of certain valleys strike upon the waters and scoop them out in a great hollow whirl the water into the air in the form of a column and of the colour of a cloud and i saw this thing happen on a sand bank in the arno where the sand was hollowed out to a greater depth than the stature of a man and with it the gravel was whirled round and flung about for a great space it appeared in the air in the form of a great bell tower and the top spread like the branches of a pine tree and then it bent at the contact of the direct wind which passed over from the mountains the element of fire acts upon a wave of air in the same way as the air does on water or as water does on a mass of sand that is earth and their motions are in the same proportions as those of the motors acting upon them of motion i ask whether the true motion of the clouds can be known by the motion of their shadows and in like manner of the motion of the sun to know better the direction of the winds footnote in connection with this text i may here mention a hygrometer

the mountains are composed its cartilage the tufa and its blood the springs of water the pool of blood which lies round the heart is the ocean and its breathing and the increase and decrease of the

the fires which in many parts of the earth find vent in baths and mines of sulphur and in volcanoes as at mount aetna in sicily and in many other places footnote compare no xvii topographical notes a large part of the texts published in this section might perhaps have found their proper place in connection with the foregoing chapters on physical geography but these observations on physical geography of whatever kind they may be as soon as they are localised acquire a special interest and importance and particularly as bearing on the question whether leonardo himself made the observations recorded at the places mentioned or merely noted the statements from hearsay in a few instances he himself tells us that he writes at second hand in some cases again although the style and expressions used make it seem highly probable that he has derived his information from others though as it seems to me these cases are not very numerous we find on the other hand among these topographical notes a great number of observations about which it is extremely difficult to form a decided opinion of what the master s life and travels may have been throughout his sixty seven years of life we know comparatively little for a long course of time and particularly from about to we do not even know with certainty that he was living in italy thus from a biographical point of view a very great interest attaches to some of the topographical notes and for this reason it seemed that it would add to their value to arrange them in a group by themselves leonardo s intimate knowledge with places some of which were certainly remote from his native home are of importance as contributing to decide the still open question as to the extent of leonardo s travels we shall find in these notes a confirmation of the view that the mss in which the topographical notes occur are in only a very few instances such diaries as may have been in use during a journey these notes are mostly found in the mss books of his later and quieter years and it is certainly remarkable that leonardo is very reticent as to the authorities from whom he quotes his facts and observations for instance as to the straits of gibraltar the nile the taurus mountains and the tigris and euphrates is it likely that he who declared that in all scientific research his own experience should be the foundation of his statements see xix philosophy no should here have made an exception to this rule without mentioning it as for instance in the discussion as to the equilibrium of the mass of water in the mediterranean sea a subject which it may be observed had at that time attracted the interest and study of hardly any other observer the acute remarks in nos on the presence of shells at the tops of mountains suffice to prove as it seems to me that it was not in his nature to allow himself to be betrayed into wide generalisations extending beyond the limits of his own investigations even by such brilliant results of personal study most of these topographical notes though suggesting very careful and thorough research do not however as has been said afford necessarily indisputable evidence that that research was leonardo s own but it must be granted that in more than one instance probability is in favour of this idea among the passages which treat somewhat fully of the topography of eastern places by far the most interesting is a description of the taurus mountains but as this text is written in the style of a formal report and in the original is associated with certain letters which give us the history of its origin i have thought it best not to sever it from that connection it will be found under no xxi letters that florence and its neighbourhood where leonardo spent his early years should be nowhere mentioned except in connection with the projects for canals which occupied his attention for some short time during the first ten years of the xvith century need not surprise us the various passages relating to the construction of canals in tuscany which are put together at the beginning are immediately followed by those which deal with schemes for canals in lombardy and after these come notes on the city and vicinity of milan as well as on the lakes of north italy the notes on some towns of central italy which leonardo visited in when in the service of cesare borgia are reproduced here in the same order as in the note book used during these travels ms l institut de france these notes have but little interest in themselves excepting as suggesting his itinerary the maps of the districts drawn by leonardo at the time are more valuable see no note the names on these maps are not written from right to left but in the usual manner and we are permitted to infer that they were made in obedience to some command possibly for the use of cesare borgia himself the fact that they remained nevertheless in leonardo s hands is not surprising when we remember the sudden political changes and warlike events of the period there can be no doubt that these maps which are here published for the first time are original in the strictest sense of the word that is to say drawn from observations of the places themselves this is proved by the fact among others that we find among his manuscripts not only the finished maps themselves but the rough sketches and studies for them and it would perhaps be difficult to point out among the abundant contributions to geographical knowledge published during the xvith century any maps at all approaching these in accuracy and finish the interesting map of the world so far as it was then known which is among the leonardo mss at windsor published in the archaeologia vol xi cannot be attributed to the master as the marchese girolamo d adda has sufficiently proved it has not therefore been reproduced here such of leonardo s observations on places in italy as were made before or after his official travels as military engineer to cesare borgia have been arranged in alphabetical order under nos the most interesting are those which relate to the alps and the appenines nos most of the passages in which france is mentioned have hitherto remained unknown as well as those which treat of the countries bordering on the mediterranean which come at the end of this section though these may be regarded as of a more questionable importance in their bearing on the biography of the master than those which mention places in france it must be allowed that they are interesting as showing the prominent place which the countries of the east held in his geographical studies he never once alludes to the discovery of america i italy canals in connection with the arno canal of florence sluices should be made in the valley of la chiana at arezzo so that when in the summer the arno lacks water the canal may not remain dry and let this canal be braccia wide at the bottom and at the top and braccia deep or so that two of these braccia may flow to the mills and the meadows which will benefit the country and prato pistoia and pisa as well as florence will gain two hundred thousand ducats a year and will lend a hand and money to this useful work and the lucchese the same for the lake of sesto will be navigable i shall direct it to prato and pistoia and cut through serravalle and make an issue into the lake for there will be no need of locks or supports which are not lasting and so will always be giving trouble in working at them and keeping them up and know that in digging this canal where it is braccia deep it will cost dinari the square braccio for twice the depth dinari if you are making braccia footnote this passage is illustrated by a slightly sketched map on which these places are indicated from west to east pisa luccha lago seravalle pistoja prato firenze and there are but banks that is to say one from the bottom of the trench to the surface of the edges of it and the other from these edges to the top of the ridge of earth which will be raised on the margin of the bank and if this bank were of double the depth only the first bank will be increased that is braccia increased by half the first cost that is to say that if at first dinari were paid for banks for it would come to at dinari the bank if the trench measured braccia at the bottom again if the trench were braccia wide and deep coming to lire for the work milan dinari the square braccio a trench which was braccia at the bottom would come to dinari the square braccio from the wall of the arno at the gate of la giustizia

be meant from the xvth to the xvith centuries it was also commonly known as porta guelfa porta san francesco del renaio porta nuova and porta reale it was close to the arno opposite to the porta san

the river in that direction the arno flows for miles between la caprona and leghorn and for through the marshes which extend miles and from la caprona up the river which makes by the arno from florence beyond miles to vico miles and the canal is from florence to fucechio it is miles by the river arno miles by the arno from florence to vico by the pistoia canal it is miles thus it is miles

of the canal of martesana by making the canal of martesana the water of the adda is greatly diminished by its distribution over many districts for the irrigation of the fields a remedy for this would be to make several little channels since the water drunk up by the earth is of no more use to any one nor mischief neither because it is taken from no one and by making these channels the water which before was lost returns again and is once more serviceable and useful to men footnote el navilio di martagano is also mentioned in a note written in red chalk ms h a leonardo has as it seems little to do with lodovico il moro s scheme to render this canal navigable the canal had been made in by bertonino da novara il moro issued his degree in but leonardo s notes about this canal were with the exception of one no written about sixteen years later no canal which is fed by a river can be permanent if the river whence it originates is not wholly closed up like the canal of martesana which is fed by the ticino from the beginning of the canal to the mill from the beginning of the canal of brivio to the mill of travaglia is trabochi that is braccia which is more than miles and two thirds and

and it is very unlikely that leonardo was in milan at that time this however would not prevent the remark which is somewhat obscure from applying to the cathedral at milan of the force of the vacuum formed in a moment i saw at milan a thunderbolt fall on the tower della credenza on its northern side and it descended with a slow motion down that side and then at once parted from that tower and carried with it and tore away from that wall a space of braccia wide and two deep and this wall was braccia thick and was built of thin and small old bricks and this was dragged out by the vacuum which the flame of the thunderbolt had caused c footnote with reference to buildings at milan see also nos and and pl xcv no explained on p pl c explained on pages see also pages and remarks on natural phenomena in and near milan i have already been to see a great variety of atmospheric effects and lately over milan towards lago maggiore i saw a cloud in the form of an immense mountain full of rifts of glowing light because the rays of the sun which was already close to the horizon and red tinged the cloud with its own hue and this cloud attracted to it all the little clouds that were near while the large one did not move from its place thus it retained on its summit the reflection of the sunlight till an hour and a half after sunset so immensely large was it and about two hours after sunset such a violent wind arose that it was really tremendous and unheard of footnote di arie is wanting in the original but may safely be inserted in the context as the formation of clouds is under discussion before this text on the th day of december at o clock a m fire was set to the place on the l th day of december at o clock a m this second fire was kindled by the swiss at milan at

the lowest part of the bank which lies across the current of the waters is made in deep and wide steps after the manner of stairs the waters which in their course usually fall perpendicularly from the top of such a place to the bottom and wear away the foundations of this bank can no longer descend with a blow of too great a force and i find the example of this in the stairs down which the water falls in the fields at sforzesca at vigevano over which the running water falls for a height of braccia stair of vigevano below la sforzesca steps braccio high and braccio wide down which the water falls so as not to wear away anything at the end of its fall by these steps so much soil has come down that it has dried up a pool that is to say it has filled it up and a pool of great depth has been turned into meadows notes on the north italian lake in many places there are streams of water which swell for six hours and ebb for six hours and i for my part have seen one above the lake of como called fonte pliniana which increases and ebbs as i have said in such a way as to turn the stones of two mills and when it fails it falls so low that it is like looking at water in a deep pit footnote the fountain is known by this name to this day it is near torno on the eastern shore of como the waters still rise and fall with the flow and ebb of the tide as pliny described it epist iv hist nat ii lake of como valley of chiavenna above the lake of como towards germany is the valley of chiavenna where the river mera flows into this lake here are barren and very high mountains with huge rocks among these mountains are to be found the water birds called gulls here grow fir trees larches and pines deer wildgoats chamois and terrible bears it is impossible to climb them without using hands and feet the peasants go there at the time of the snows with great snares to make the bears fall down these rocks these mountains which very closely approach each other are parted by the river they are to the right and left for the distance of miles throughout of the same nature from mile to mile there are good inns above on the said river there are waterfalls of braccia in height which are fine to see and there is good living at soldi the reckoning this river brings down a great deal of timber val sasina val sasina runs down towards italy this is almost the same form and character there grow here many mappello and there are great ruins and falls of water footnote the meaning of mappello is unknown valley of introzzo this valley produces a great quantity of firs pines and larches and from here ambrogio fereri has his timber brought down at the head of the valtellina are the mountains of bormio terrible and always covered with snow marmots are found there bellaggio opposite the castle bellaggio there is the river latte which falls from a height of more than braccia from the source whence it springs perpendicularly into the lake with an inconceivable roar and noise this spring flows only in august and september valtellina valtellina as it is called is a valley enclosed in high and terrible mountains it produces much strong wine and there is so much cattle that the natives conclude that more milk than wine grows there this is the valley through which the adda passes which first runs more than miles through germany this river breeds the fish temolo which live on silver of which much is to be found in its sands in this country every one can sell bread and wine and the wine is worth at most one soldo the bottle and a pound of veal one soldo and salt ten dinari and butter the same and their pound is ounces and eggs are one soldo the lot at bormio at bormio are the baths about eight miles above como is the pliniana which increases and ebbs every six hours and its swell supplies water for two mills and its ebbing makes the spring dry up two miles higher up there is nesso a place where a river falls with great violence into a vast rift in the mountain these excursions are to be made in the month of may and the largest bare rocks that are to be found in this part of the country are the mountains of mandello near to those of lecco and of gravidona towards bellinzona miles from lecco and those of the valley of chiavenna but the greatest of all is that of mandello which has at its base an opening towards the lake which goes down steps and there at all times is ice and wind in val sasina in val sasina between vimognio and introbbio to the right hand going in by the road to lecco is the river troggia which falls from a very high rock and as it falls it goes underground and the river ends there miles farther we find the buildings of the mines of copper and silver near a place called pra santo pietro and mines of iron and curious things la grigna is the highest mountain there is in this part and it is quite bare footnote and from the character of the handwriting we may conclude that these observations were made in leonardo s youth and i should infer from their contents that they were notes made in anticipation of a visit to the places here described and derived from some person unknown to us who had given him an account of them the lake of pusiano flows into the lake of segrino footnote the statement about the lake segrino is incorrect it is situated in the valle assina above the lake of pusiano and of annone and of sala the lake of annone is braccia higher at the surface of its water than the surface of the water of the lake of lecco and the lake of pusiano is braccia higher than the lake of annone which added to the afore said braccia make braccia and this is the greatest height of the surface of the lake of pusiano above the surface of the lake of lecco footnote this text has in the original a slight sketch to illustrate it at santa maria in the valley of ravagnate footnote ravagnate leonardo writes ravagna in the brianza is between oggiono and brivio south of the lake of como m ravaisson avails himself of this note

realm of all stupidity vehicles with four wheels are used of which o the two in front are small and two high ones are behind an arrangement which is very unfavourable to the motion because on the fore wheels more weight is laid than on those behind as i showed in the first of the th on elements thus grapes are carried at cesena the number of the diggers of the ditches is arranged pyramidically

the parts which have come out blackish close to the river are yellow ochre in the original the dark groups of houses inside the town are red at the four points of the compass drawn in the middle of the town leonardo has written from right to left mezzodi south at the top to the left scirocho south east levante east greco north east septantrione north maesstro north west ponente west libecco south west the arch in which the plan is drawn is in the original centimetres across at the beginning of october cesare borgia was shut up in imola by a sudden revolt of the condottieri and it was some weeks before he could release himself from this state of siege see gregorovius geschichte der stadt rom im mittelalter vol vii book xiii besides this incident imola plays no important part in the history of the time i therefore think myself fully justified in connecting this map which is at windsor with the siege of and with leonardo s engagements in the service of cesare borgia because a comparison of these texts nos and raise i believe the hypothesis to a certainty from bonconventi to casa nova are miles from casa nova to chiusi miles from chiusi to perugia from perugia to santa maria degli angeli and then to fuligno footnote most of the places here described lie within the district shown in the maps on pl cxiii on the first of august the library at pesaro of painting on the tops and sides of hills foreshorten the shape of the ground and its divisions but give its proper shape to what is turned towards you footnote this passage evidently refers to the making of maps such as pl cxii cxiii and cxiv there is no mention of such works it is true excepting in this one passage of ms l but this can scarcely be taken as evidence against my view that leonardo busied himself very extensively at that time in the construction of maps and all the less since the foregoing chapters clearly prove that at a time so full of events leonardo would only now and then commit his observations to paper in the ms l by the side of this text we find in the original a very indistinct sketch perhaps a plan of a position instead of this drawing i have here inserted a much clearer sketch of a position from the same ms l b and a they are the only drawings of landscape it may be noted which occur at all in that ms alessandria in piedmont at candia in lombardy near alessandria della paglia in making a well for messer gualtieri footnote messer gualtieri the same probably as is mentioned in nos and of candia the skeleton of a very large boat was found about braccia underground and as the timber was black and fine it seemed good to the said messer gualtieri to have the mouth of the well lengthened in such a way as that the ends of the boat should be uncovered at alessandria della paglia in lombardy there are no stones for making lime of but such as are mixed up with an infinite variety of things native to the sea which is now more than miles away the alps at monbracco above saluzzo a mile above the certosa at the foot of monte viso there is a quarry of flakey stone which is as white as carrara marble without a spot and as hard as porphyry or even harder of which my worthy gossip master benedetto the sculptor has promised to give me a small slab for the colours the second day of january footnote saluzzo at the foot of the alps south of turin footnote maestro benedetto scultore probably some native of northern italy acquainted with the place here described hardly the florentine sculptor benedetto da majano amoretti had published this passage and m ravaisson who gave a french translation of it in the gazette des beaux arts pag remarks as follows le maitre sculpteur que leonard appelle son compare ne serait il pas benedetto da majano un de ceux qui jugerent avec lui de la place a donner au david de michel ange et de qui le louvre a acquis recemment un buste d apres philippe strozzi to this it may be objected that benedetto da majano had already lain in his grave fourteen years in the year when he is supposed to have given the promise to leonardo the colours may have been given to the sculptor benedetto and the stone may have been in payment for them from the description of the stone here given we may conclude that it is repeated from hearsay of the sculptor s account of it i do not understand how from this observation it is possible to conclude that leonardo was on the spot that there are springs which suddenly break forth in earthquakes or other convulsions and suddenly fail and this happened in a mountain in savoy where certain forests sank in and left a very deep gap and about four miles from here the earth opened itself like a gulf in the mountain and threw out a sudden and immense flood of water which scoured the whole of a little valley of the tilled soil vineyards and houses and did the greatest mischief wherever it overflowed the river arve a quarter of a mile from geneva in savoy where the fair is held on midsummerday in the village of saint gervais footnote an indistinct sketch is to be seen by the text and this may be seen as i saw it by any one going up monbroso footnote i have vainly enquired of every available authority for a solution of the mystery as to what mountain is intended by the name monboso comp vol i nos and it seems most obvious to refer it to monte rosa rosa derived from the keltic ros which survives in breton and in gaelic meaning in its first sense a mountain spur but which also like horn means a very high peak thus monte rosa would mean literally the high peak a peak of the alps which divide france from italy the base of this mountain gives birth to the rivers which flow in four different directions through the whole of europe and no mountain has its base at so great a height as this which lifts itself above almost all the clouds and snow seldom falls there but only hail in the summer when the clouds are highest and this hail lies unmelted there so that if it were not for the absorption of the rising and falling clouds which does not happen more than twice in an age an enormous mass of ice would be piled up there by the layers of hail and in the middle of july i found it very considerable and i saw the sky above me quite dark and the sun as it fell on the mountain was far brighter here than in the plains below because a smaller extent of atmosphere lay between the summit of the mountain and the sun footnote in una eta this is perhaps a slip of the pen on leonardo s part and should be read estate summer leic b in the mountains of verona the red marble is found all mixed with cockle shells turned into stone some of them have been filled at the mouth with the cement which is the substance of the stone and in some parts they have remained separate from the mass of the rock which enclosed them because the outer covering of the shell had interposed and had not allowed them to unite with it while in other places this cement had petrified those which were old and almost stripped the outer skin bridge of goertz wilbach footnote there is a slight sketch with this text leonardo seems to have intended to suggest with a few pen strokes the course of the isonzo and of the wipbach in the vicinity of gorizia goerz he himself says in another place that he had been in friuli see no the appenins that part of the earth which was lightest remained farthest from the centre of the world and that part of the earth became the lightest over which the greatest quantity of water flowed and therefore that part became lightest where the greatest number of rivers flow like the alps which divide germany and france from italy whence issue the rhone flowing southwards and the rhine to the north the danube or tanoia towards the north east and the po to the east with innumerable rivers which join them and which always run turbid with the soil carried by them to the sea the shores of the sea are constantly moving towards the middle of the sea and displace it from its original position the lowest portion of the mediterranean will be reserved for the bed and current of the nile the largest river that flows into that sea and with it are grouped all its tributaries which at first fell into the sea as may be seen with the po and its tributaries which first fell into that sea which between the appenines and the german alps was united to the adriatic sea that the gallic alps are the highest part of europe and of these i found some in the rocks of the high appenines and mostly at the rock of la vernia footnote sasso della vernia the frowning rock between the sources of the arno and the tiber as dante describes this mountain which is metres in height this note is written by the side of that given as no but their connection does not make it clear what leonardo s purpose was in writing it at parma at la campana on the twenty fifth of october footnote capano an inn a note on the petrifactions or fossils near parma will be found under no a method for drying the marsh of piombino footnote there is a slight sketch with this text in the original piombino is also mentioned in nos l compare pl xxxv below also in no the shepherds in the romagna at the foot of the apennines make peculiar large cavities in the mountains in the form of a horn and on one side they fasten a horn this little horn becomes one and the same with the said cavity and thus they produce by blowing into it a very loud noise footnote as to the romagna see also no a spring may be seen to rise in sicily which at certain times of the year throws out chesnut leaves in quantities but in sicily chesnuts do not grow hence it is evident that that spring must issue from some abyss in italy and then flow beneath the sea to break forth in sicily footnote the chesnut tree is very common in sicily in writing cicilia leonardo meant perhaps cilicia ii france germany france a austria a picardy b saxony b normandy c nuremberg c dauphine d flanders spain a biscay b castille c galicia d portugal e taragona f granada footnote two slightly sketched maps one of europe the other of spain are at the side of these notes perpignan roanne lyons

leonardo s time was still a place of some consequence at bordeaux in gascony the sea rises about braccia before its ebb and the river there is filled with salt water for more than a hundred and fifty miles and the vessels which are repaired there rest high and dry on a high hill above the sea at low tide footnote this is obviously an exaggeration founded on inaccurate information half of miles would be nearer the mark the rhone issues from the lake of geneva and flows first to the west and then to the south with a course of miles and pours its waters into the mediterranean c d is the garden

f f g is where the siphon discharges into the river footnote the tenor of this note see lines and seems to me to indicate that this passage was not written in france but was written from oral information we have no evidence as to when this note may have been written beyond the circumstance that fra giocondo the veronese architect left france not before the year the greater part of the magnificent chateau of blois has now disappeared whether this note was made for a special purpose is uncertain the original form and extent of the chateau is shown in androvet les plus excellents

smaller island a is written on the margin on the bank of the river above i in the reproduction it is not visible as may be seen from the last sentence the observation was made after long study of the river s course when leonardo had resided for some time at or near amboise the water may be dammed up above the level of romorantin to such a height that in its fall it may be used for numerous mills the river at villefranche may be conducted to romorantin which may be done by the inhabitants and the timber of which their houses are built may be carried in boats to romorantin footnote compare no the river may be dammed up at such a height that the waters may be brought back to romorantin with a convenient fall as to whether it is better that the water should all be raised in a single turn or in two the answer is that in one single turn the wheel could not support all the water that it can raise in two turns because at the half turn of the wheel it would be raising pounds and no more and if it had to raise the whole pounds in one turn it could not raise them unless the wheel were of double the diameter and if the diameter were doubled the time of its revolution would be doubled therefore it is better and a greater advantage in expense to make such a wheel of half the size the land which it would water and would render the country fertile to supply food to the inhabitants and would make navigable canals for mercantile purposes the way in which the river in its flow should scour its own channel by the ninth of the third the more rapid it is the more it wears away its channel and by the converse proposition the slower the water the more it deposits that which renders it turbid and let the sluice be movable like the one i arranged in friuli footnote this passage reveals to us the fact that leonardo had visited the country of friuli and that he had stayed there for some time nothing whatever was known of this previously where when one sluice was opened the water which passed through it dug out the bottom therefore when the rivers are flooded the sluices of the mills ought to be opened in order that the whole course of the river may pass through falls to each mill there should be many in order to give a greater impetus and so all the river will be scoured and below the site of each of the two mills there may be one of the said sluice falls one of them may be placed below each mill a trabocco is four braccia and one mile is three thousand of the said braccia each braccio is divided into inches and the water in the canals has a fall in every hundred trabocchi of two of these inches therefore inches of fall are necessary in two thousand eight hundred braccia of flow in these canals it follows that inches of fall give the required momentum to the currents of the waters in the said canals that is one braccio and a half in the mile and from this it may be concluded that the water taken from the river of ville franche and lent to the river of romorantin will where one river by reason of its low level cannot flow into the other it will be necessary to dam it up so that it may acquire a fall into the other which was previously the higher the

footnote there is with this passage a sketch of a round tower shrouded in smoke the danube that the valleys were formerly in great part covered by lakes the soil of which always forms the banks of rivers and by seas which afterwards by the persistent wearing of the rivers cut through the mountains and the wandering courses of the rivers carried away the other plains enclosed by the mountains and the cutting away of the mountains is evident from the strata in the rocks which correspond in their sections as made by the courses of the rivers footnote emus the balkan dardania now servia the haemus mountains which go along thrace and dardania and join the sardonius mountains which going on to the westward change their name from sardus to rebi as they come near dalmatia then turning to the west cross illyria now called sclavonia changing the name of rebi to albanus and going on still to the west they change to mount ocra in the north and to the south above istria they are named caruancas and to the west above italy they join the adula where the danube rises which stretches to the east and has a course of miles its shortest line is about l miles and the same or about the same is that branch of the adula mountains changed as to their name as before mentioned to the north are the carpathians closing in the breadth of the valley of the danube which as i have said extends eastward a length of about miles and is sometimes and in some places miles wide and in the midst flows the danube the principal river of europe as to size the said danube runs through the middle of austria and albania and northwards through bavaria poland hungary wallachia and bosnia and then the danube or donau flows into the black sea which formerly extended almost to austria and occupied the plains through which the danube now courses and the evidence of this is in the oysters and cockle shells and scollops and bones of great fishes which are still to be found in many places on the sides of those mountains and this sea was formed by the filling up of the spurs of the adula mountains which then extended to the east joining the spurs of the taurus which extend to the west and near bithynia the waters of this black sea poured into the propontis marmora falling into the aegean sea that is the mediterranean where after a long course the spurs of the adula mountains became separated from those of the taurus the black sea sank lower and laid bare the valley of the danube with the above named countries and the whole of asia minor beyond the taurus range to the north and the plains from mount caucasus to the black sea to the west and the plains of the don this side that is to say at the foot of the ural mountains and thus the black sea must have sunk about braccia to uncover such vast plains footnote danubio in the original reno evidently a mistake as we may infer from come dissi l c iii the countries of the western end of the mediterranean the straits of gibraltar why the sea makes a stronger current in the straits of spain than elsewhere a river of equal depth runs with greater speed in a narrow space than in a wide one in proportion to the difference between the wider and the narrower one this proposition is clearly proved by reason confirmed by experiment supposing that through a channel one mile wide there flows one mile in length of water where the river is five miles wide each of the square miles will require of itself to be equal to the square mile of water required in the sea and where the river is miles wide each of these square miles will require the third of its volume to make up the amount of the square mile of the narrow part as is demonstrated in f g h at the mile marked n footnote in the place marked a in the diagram mare mediterano mediterranean sea is written in the original and at b stretto di spugna straits of spain i e gibraltar compare no why the current of gibraltar is always greater to the west than to the east the reason is that if you put together the mouths of the rivers which discharge into the mediterranean sea you would find the sum of water to be larger than that which this sea pours through the straits into the ocean you see africa discharging its rivers that run northwards into this sea and among them the nile which runs through miles of africa there is also the bagrada river and the schelif and others footnote bagrada leonardo writes bragada in tunis now medscherda mavretano now schelif likewise europe pours into it the don and the danube the po the rhone the arno and the tiber so that evidently these rivers with an infinite number of others of less fame make its great breadth and depth and current and the sea is not wider than miles at the most westerly point of land where it divides europe from africa the gulf of the mediterranean as an inland sea received the principal waters of africa asia and europe that flowed towards it and its waters came up to the foot of the mountains that surrounded it and made its shores and the summits of the apennines stood up out of this sea like islands surrounded by salt water africa again behind its atlas mountains did not expose uncovered to the sky the surface of its vast plains about miles in length and memphis footnote mefi leonardo can only mean here the citadel of cairo on the mokattam hills was on the shores of this sea and above the plains of italy where now birds fly in flocks fish were wont to wander in large shoals tunis the greatest ebb made anywhere by the mediterranean is above tunis being about two and a half braccia and at venice it falls two braccia in all the rest of the mediterranean sea the fall is little or none libya describe the mountains of shifting deserts that is to say the formation of waves of sand borne by the wind and of its mountains and hills such as occur in libya examples may be seen on the wide sands of the po and the ticino and other large rivers majorca circumfulgore is a naval machine it was an invention of the men of majorca footnote the machine is fully described in the ms and shown in a sketch the tyrrhene sea some at the tyrrhene sea employ this method that is to say they fastened an anchor to one end of the yard and to the other a cord of which the lower end was fastened to an anchor and in battle they flung this anchor on to the oars of the opponent s boat and by the use of a capstan drew it to the side and threw soft soap and tow daubed with pitch and set ablaze on to that side where the anchor hung so that in order to escape that fire the defenders of that ship had to fly to the opposite side and in doing this they aided to the attack because the galley was more easily drawn to the side by reason of the counterpoise footnote this text is illustrated in the original by a pen and ink sketch iv the levant the levantine sea on the shores of the mediterranean rivers flow and ports and this sea is miles long many times has the increase of its waters heaped up by their backward flow and the blowing of the west winds caused the overflow of the nile and of the rivers which flow out through the black sea and have so much raised the seas that they have spread with vast floods over many countries and these floods take place at the time when the sun melts the snows on the high mountains of ethiopia that rise up into the cold regions of the air and in the same way the approach of the sun acts on the mountains of sarmatia in asia and on those in europe so that the gathering together of these three things are and always have been the cause of tremendous floods that is the return flow of the sea with the west wind and the melting of the snows so every river will overflow in syria in samaria in judea between sinai and the lebanon and in the rest of syria between the lebanon and the taurus mountains and in cilicia in the armenian mountains and in pamphilia and in lycia within the hills and in egypt as far as the atlas mountains the gulf of persia which was formerly a vast lake of the tigris and discharged into the indian sea has now worn away the mountains which formed its banks and laid them even with the level of the indian ocean and if the mediterranean had continued its flow through the gulf of arabia it would have done the same that is to say would have reduced the level of the mediterranean to that of the indian sea the red sea for a long time the water of the mediterranean flowed out through the red sea which is miles wide and long and full of reefs and it has worn away the sides of mount sinai a fact which testifies not to an inundation from the indian sea beating on these coasts but to a deluge of water which carried with it all the rivers which abound round the mediterranean and besides this there is the reflux of the sea and then a cutting being made to the west miles away from this place gibraltar was separated from ceuta which had been joined to it and this passage was cut very low down in the plains between gibraltar and the ocean at the foot of the mountain in the low part aided by the hollowing out of some valleys made by certain rivers which might have flowed here hercules footnote leonardo seems here to mention hercules half jestingly and only in order to suggest to the reader an allusion to the legend of the pillars of hercules came to open the sea to the westward and then the sea waters began to pour into the western ocean and in consequence of this great fall the red sea remained the higher whence the water abandoning its course here ever after poured away through the straits of spain the surface of the red sea is on a level with the ocean a mountain may have fallen and closed the mouth of the red sea and prevented the outlet of the mediterranean and the mediterranean sea thus overfilled had for outlet the passage below the mountains of gades for in our own times a similar thing has been seen footnote compare also no ll and paolo giovio the celebrated historian born at como in reports that in at the foot of the alps above bellinzona on the road to switzerland a mountain fell with a very great noise in consequence of an earthquake and that the mass of rocks which fell on the left western side blocked the river breno t i p and of d sauvage s french edition quoted in alexis percy memoire des tremblements de terre de la peninsule italique academie royale de belgique t xxii a mountain fell seven miles across a valley and closed it up and made a lake and thus most lakes have been made by mountains as the lake of garda the lakes of como and lugano and the lago maggiore the mediterranean fell but little on the confines of syria in consequence of the gaditanean passage but a great deal in this passage because before this cutting was made the mediterranean sea flowed to the south east and then the fall had to be made by its run through the straits of gades at a the water of the mediterranean fell into the ocean all the plains which lie between the sea and mountains were formerly covered with salt water every valley has been made by its own river and the proportion between valleys is the same as that between river and river the greatest river in our world is the mediterranean river which moves from the sources of the nile to the western ocean and its greatest height is in outer mauritania and it has a course of ten thousand miles before it reunites with its ocean the father of the waters that is miles for the mediterranean for the nile as far as discovered and for the nile which flows to the east c footnote see pl cxi a sketch of the shores of the mediterranean sea where lines to may be seen the large figures are not in leonardo s writing the character of the writing leads us to conclude that this text was written later than the foregoing a slight sketch of the mediterranean is also to be found in ms i a the nile therefore we must conclude those mountains to be of the greatest height above which the clouds falling in snow give rise to the nile the egyptians the ethiopians and the arabs in crossing the nile with camels are accustomed to attach two bags on the sides of the camel s bodies that is skins in the form shown underneath in these four meshes of the net the camels for baggage place their feet footnote unfortunately both the sketches which accompany this passage are too much effaced to be reproduced the upper represents the two sacks joined by ropes as here described the other shows four camels with riders swimming through a river the tigris passes through asia minor and brings with it the water of three lakes one after the other of various elevations the first being munace and the middle pallas and the lowest triton and the nile again springs from three very high lakes in ethiopia and runs northwards towards the sea of egypt with a course of miles and by the shortest and straightest line it is miles it is said that it issues from the mountains of the moon and has various unknown sources the said lakes are about braccia above the surface of the sphere of water that is mile and giving to the nile a fall of braccia in every mile footnote incogniti principio the affluents of the lakes are probably here intended compare as to the nile nos and very many times the nile and other very large rivers have poured out their whole element of water and restored it to the sea why does the inundation of the nile occur in the summer coming from torrid countries it is not denied that the nile is constantly muddy in entering the egyptian sea and that its turbidity is caused by soil that this river is continually bringing from the places it passes which soil never returns in the sea which receives it unless it throws it on its shores you see the sandy desert beyond mount atlas where formerly it was covered with salt water customs of asiatic nations the assyrians and the people of euboea accustom their horses to carry sacks which they can at pleasure fill with air and which in case of need they carry instead of the girth of the saddle above and at the side and they are well covered with plates of cuir bouilli in order that they may not be perforated by flights of arrows thus they have not on their minds their security in flight when the victory is uncertain a horse thus equipped enables four or five men to cross over at need small boats the small boats used by the assyrians were made of thin laths of willow plaited over rods also of willow and bent into the form of a boat they were daubed with fine mud soaked with oil or with turpentine and reduced to a kind of mud which resisted the water and because pine would split and always remained fresh and they covered this sort of boats with the skins of oxen in safely crossing the river sicuris of spain as is reported by lucant footnote see lucan s pharsalia iv utque habuit ripas sicoris camposque reliquit primum cana salix madefacto vimine parvam texitur in puppim calsoque inducto juvenco

rhodes in fourteen hundred and eighty nine there was an earthquake in the sea of atalia near rhodes which opened the sea that is its bottom and into this opening such a torrent of water poured that for more than three hours the bottom of the sea was uncovered by reason of the water which was lost in it and then it closed to the former level footnote nello ottanto it is scarcely likely that leonardo should here mean ad dr h muller strubing writes to me as follows on this subject with reference to rhodes ross says reise auf den griechischen inseln iii ff that ancient history affords instances of severe earthquakes at rhodes among others one in the second year of the th olympiad b c a remarkably violent one under antoninus pius a d and again under constantine and later but leonardo expressly speaks of an earthquake nel mar di atalia presso a rodi which is singular the town of attalia founded by attalus which is what he no doubt means was in pamphylia and more than english miles east of rhodes in a straight line leake and most other geographers identify it with the present town of adalia attalia is rarely mentioned by the ancients indeed only by strabo and pliny and no earthquake is spoken of i think therefore you are justified in assuming that leonardo means in the elaborate catalogue of earthquakes in the east by sciale dshelal eddin sayouthy an unpublished arabic ms in the possession of prof schefer membre de l institut paris mention is made of a terrible earthquake in the year of the mohamedan era corresponding to the year and it is there stated that a hundred persons were killed by it in the fortress of kerak there are three places of this name kerak on the sea of tiberias kerak near tahle on the libanon which i visited in the summer of l but neither of these is the place alluded to possibly it may be the strongly fortified town of kerak kir moab to the west of the dead sea there is no notice about this in alexis percy memoire sur les

cyprus site for a temple of venus you must make steps on four sides by which to mount to a meadow formed by nature at the top of a rock which may be hollowed out and supported in front by pilasters and open underneath in a large portico footnote see pl lxxxiii compare also p of this vol the standing male figure at the side is evidently suggested by michael angelo s david on the same place a slight sketch of horses seems to have been drawn first there is no reason for assuming that the text and this sketch which have no connection with each other are of the same date sito di venere by this heading leonardo appears to mean cyprus which was always considered by the ancients to be the home and birth place of aphrodite kirpic in homer in which the water may fall into various vases of granite porphyryand serpentine within semi circular recesses and the water may overflow from these and round this portico towards the north there should be a lake with a little island in the midst of which should be a thick and shady wood the waters at the top of the pilasters should pour into vases at their base from whence they should flow in little channels starting from the shore of cilicia towards the south you discover the beauties of the island of cyprus the caspian sea from the shore of the southern coast of cilicia may be seen to the south the beautiful island of cyprus which was the realm of the goddess venus and many navigators being attracted by her beauty had their ships and rigging broken amidst the reefs surrounded by the whirling waters here the beauty of delightful hills tempts wandering mariners to refresh themselves amidst their flowery verdure where the winds are tempered and fill the island and the surrounding seas with fragrant odours ah how many a ship has here been sunk ah how many a vessel broken on these rocks here might be seen barks without number some wrecked and half covered by the sand others showing the poop and another the prow here a keel and there the ribs and it seems like a day of judgment when there should be a resurrection of dead ships so great is the number of them covering all the northern shore and while the north gale makes various and fearful noises there write to bartolomeo the turk as to the flow and ebb of the black sea and whether he is aware if there be such a flow and ebb in the hyrcanean or caspian sea footnote the handwriting of this note points to a late date why water is found at the top of mountains from the straits of gibraltar to the don is miles that is one mile and giving a fall of one braccio in a mile to any water that moves gently the caspian sea is a great deal higher and none of the mountains of europe rise a mile above the surface of our seas therefore it might be said that the water which is on the summits of our mountains might come from the height of those seas and of the rivers which flow into them and which are still higher the sea of azov hence it follows that the sea of azov is the highest part of the mediterranean sea being at a distance of miles from the straits of gibraltar as is shown by the map for navigation and it has braccia of descent that is one mile and therefore it is higher than any mountains which exist in the west footnote the passage before this in the original treats of the exit of the waters from lakes in general the dardanelles in the bosphorus the black sea flows always into the egean sea and the egean sea never flows into it and this is because the caspian which is miles to the east with the rivers which pour into it always flows through subterranean caves into this sea of pontus and the don does the same as well as the danube so that the waters of pontus are always higher than those of the egean for the higher always fall towards the lower and never the lower towards the higher constantinople the bridge of pera at constantinople braccia wide braccia high above the water braccia long that is over the sea and on the land thus making its own abutments footnote see pl cx no in by order of sultan mohamed ii the golden horn was crossed by a pontoon bridge laid on barrels see joh dukas history of the byzantine empire xxxviii p the biographers of michelangelo vasari as well as condivi relate that at the time when michelangelo suddenly left rome in he entertained some intention of going to constantinople there to serve the sultan who sought to engage him by means of certain franciscan monks for the purpose of constructing a bridge to connect constantinople with pera see vasari vite ed sansoni vii michelangelo veduto questa furia del papa dubitando di lui ebbe secondo che si dice voglia di andarsene in gostantinopoli a servire il turco per mezzo di certi frati di san francesco che desiderava averlo per fare un ponte che

dal turco ricercato con grandissime promesse per mezzo di certi frati di san francesco per volersene servire in fare un ponte da costantinopoli a pera ed in altri affari leonardo s plan for this bridge was made in we may therefore conclude that at about that time the sultan bajazet ii had either announced a competition in this matter or that through his agents leonardo had first been called upon to carry out the scheme the euphrates if the river will turn to the rift farther on it will never return to its bed as the euphrates does and this may do at bologna the one who is disappointed for his rivers centrae asia mounts caucasus comedorum and paropemisidae are joined together between bactria and india and give birth to the river oxus which takes its rise in these mountains and flows miles towards the north and as many towards the west and discharges its waters into the caspian sea and is accompanied by the oxus dargados arthamis xariaspes dargamaim ocus and margus all very large rivers from the opposite side towards the south rises the great river indus which sends its waters for miles southwards and receives as tributaries in this course the rivers xaradrus hyphasis vadris vandabal bislaspus to the east suastes and coe to the west uniting with these rivers and with their waters it flows miles to the west then turning back by the arbiti mountains makes an elbow and turns southwards where after a course of about miles it finds the indian sea in which it pours itself by seven branches on the side of the same mountains rises the great ganges which river flows southwards for miles and to the southwest a thousand and sarabas diarnuna soas and scilo condranunda are its tributaries it flows into the indian sea by many mouths on the natives of hot countries men born in hot countries love the night because it refreshes them and have a horror of light because it burns them and therefore they are of the colour of night that is black and in cold countries it is just the contrary footnote the sketch here inserted is in ms h b xviii naval warfare mechanical appliances music such theoretical questions as have been laid before the reader in sections xvi and xvii though they were the chief subjects of leonardo s studies of the sea did not exclusively claim his attention a few passages have been collected at the beginning of this section which prove that he had turned his mind to the practical problems of navigation and more especially of naval warfare what we know for certain of his life gives us no data it is true as to when or where these matters came under his consideration but the fact remains certain both from these notes in his manuscripts and from the well known letter to ludovico il moro no in which he expressly states that he is as capable as any man in this very department the numerous notes as to the laws and rationale of the flight of birds are scattered through several note books an account of these is given in the bibliography of the manuscripts at the end of this work it seems probable that the idea which led him to these investigations was his desire to construct a flying or aerial machine for man at the same time it must be admitted that the notes on the two subjects are quite unconnected in the manuscripts and that those on the flight of birds are by far the most numerous and extensive the two most important passages that treat of the construction of a flying machine are those already published as tav xvi no and tav xviii in the saggio delle opere di leonardo da vinci milan the passages nos here printed for the first time and hitherto unknown refer to the same subject and with the exception of one already published in the saggio no they are so far as i know the only notes among the numerous observations on the flight of birds in which the phenomena are incidentally and expressly connected with the idea of a flying machine the notes on machines of war the construction of fortifications and similar matters which fall within the department of the engineer have not been included in this work for the reasons given on page of this vol an exception has been made in favour of the passages nos and because they have a more general interest as bearing on the important question whence the master derived his knowledge of these matters though it would be rash to assert that leonardo was the first to introduce the science of mining into italy it may be confidently said that he is one of the earliest writers who can be proved to have known and understood it while on the other hand it is almost beyond doubt that in the east at that time the whole science of besieging towns and mining in particular was far more advanced than in europe this gives a peculiar value to the expressions used in no i have been unable to find in the manuscripts any passage whatever which throws any light on leonardo s great reputation as a musician nothing therein illustrates vasarps well known statement avvenne che morto giovan galeazze duca di milano e creato lodovico sforza nel grado medesimo anno fu condotto a milano con gran riputazione lionardo al duca il quale molto si dilettava del suono della lira

tuba e piu sonora di voce laonde supero tutti i musici che quivi erano concorsi a sonare the only notes on musical matters are those given as nos and which explain certain arrangements in instruments the ship s logs of vitruvius of alberti and of leonardo on movements to know how much a ship advances in an hour the ancients used various devices to ascertain the distance gone by a ship each hour among which vitruvius footnote see vitruvius de architectura lib x c p in the edition of rose and muller strubing the german edition published at bale in has on fol an illustration of the contrivance as described by vitruvius gives one in his work on architecture which is just as fallacious as all the others and this is a mill wheel which touches the waves of the sea at one end and in each complete revolution describes a straight line which represents the circumference of the wheel extended to a straightness but this invention is of no worth excepting on the smooth and motionless surface of lakes but if the water moves together with the ship at an equal rate then the wheel remains motionless and if the motion of the water is more or less rapid than that of the ship then

is done by a board or under the pressure of wind which strikes on it with more or less swiftness this is in battista alberti footnote leon battista alberti de architectura lib v c treats de le navi e

which is made by experiment on a known distance between one island and another but such an invention does not succeed excepting on a ship like the one on which the experiment was made and it must be of the same burden and have the same sails and the sails in the same places and the size of the waves must be the same but my method will serve for any ship whether with oars or sails and whether it be small or large broad or long or high or low it always serves footnote leonardo does not reveal the method invented by him methods of staying and moving in water how an army ought to cross rivers by swimming with air bags how fishes swim footnote compare no of the way in which they jump out of the water as may be seen with dolphins and it seems a wonderful thing to make a leap from a thing which does not resist but slips away of the swimming of animals of a long form such as eels and the like of the mode of swimming against currents and in the rapid falls of rivers of the mode of swimming of fishes of a round form how it is that animals which have not long hind quartres cannot swim how it is that all other animals which have feet with toes know by nature how to swim excepting man in what way man ought to learn to swim of the way in which man may rest on the water how man may protect himself against whirlpools or eddies in the water which drag him down how a man dragged to the bottom must seek the reflux which will throw him up from the depths how he ought to move his arms how to swim on his back how he can and how he cannot stay under water unless he can hold his breath how by means of a certain machine many people may stay some time under water how and why i do not describe my method of remaining under water or how long i can stay without eating and i do not publish nor divulge these by reason of the evil nature of men who would use them as means of destruction at the bottom of the sea by sending ships to the bottom and sinking them together with the men in them and although i will impart others there is no danger in them because the mouth of the tube by which you breathe is above the water supported on bags or corks footnote l will also be found in vol i no on naval warfare supposing in a battle between ships and galleys that the ships are victorious by reason of the high of heir tops you must haul the yard up almost to the top of the mast and at the extremity of the yard that is the end which is turned towards the enemy have a small cage fastened wrapped up below and all round in a great mattress full of cotton so that it may not be injured by the bombs then with the capstan haul down the opposite end of this yard and the top on the opposite side will go up so high that it will be far above the round top of the ship and you will easily drive out the men that are in it but it is necessary that the men who are in the galley should go to the opposite side of it so as to afford a counterpoise to the weight of the men placed inside the cage on the yard if you want to build an armada for the sea employ these ships to ram in the enemy s ships that is make ships feet long and feet wide but arranged so that the left hand rowers may have their oars to the right side of the ship and the right hand ones to the left side as is shown at m so that the leverage of the oars may be longer and the said ship may be one foot and a half thick that is made with cross beams within and without with planks in contrary directions and this ship must have attached to it a foot below the water an iron shod spike of about the weight and size of an anvil and this by force of oars may after it has given the first blow be drawn back and driven forward again with fury give a second blow and then a third and so many as to destroy the other ship the use of swimming belts a method of escaping in a tempest and shipwreck at sea have a coat made of leather which must be double across the breast that is having a hem on each side of about a finger breadth thus it will be double from the waist to the knee and the leather must be quite air tight when you want to leap into the sea blow out the skirt of your coat through the double hems of the breast and jump into the sea and allow yourself to be carried by the waves when you see no shore near give your attention to the sea you are in and always keep in your mouth the air tube which leads down into the coat and if now and again you require to take a breath of fresh air and the foam prevents you you may draw a breath of the air within the coat footnote amoretti memorie storiche tav ii b

passage in the original on flying machines man when flying must stand free from the waist upwards so as to be able to balance himself as he does in a boat so that the centre of gravity in himself and in the machine may counterbalance each other and be shifted as necessity demands for the changes of its centre of resistance remember that your flying machine must imitate no other than the bat because the web is what by its union gives the armour or strength to the wings if you imitate the wings of feathered birds you will find a much stronger structure because they are pervious that is their feathers are separate and the air passes through them but the bat is aided by the web that connects the whole and is not pervious to escape the peril of destruction destruction to such a machine may occur in two ways of which the first is the breaking of the machine the second would be when the machine should turn on its edge or nearly on its edge because it ought always to descend in a highly oblique direction and almost exactly balanced on its centre as regards the first the breaking of the machine that may be prevented by making it as strong as possible and in whichever direction it may tend to turn over one centre must be very far from the other that is in a machine braccia long the centres must be braccia one from the other footnote compare no bags by which a man falling from a height of braccia may avoid hurting himself by a fall whether into water or on the ground and these bags strung together like a rosary are to be fixed on one s back an object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to the object you may see that the beating of its wings against the air supports a heavy eagle in the highest and rarest atmosphere close to the sphere of elemental fire again you may see the air in motion over the sea fill the swelling sails and drive heavily laden ships from these instances and the reasons given a man with wings large enough and duly connected might learn to overcome the resistance of the air and by conquering it succeed in subjugating it and rising above it footnote a parachute is here sketched with an explanatory remark it is

and speculations vasari indulges in severe strictures on leonardo s religious views he speaks among other things of his capricci nel filosofar delle cose naturali and says on this point per il che fece nell animo un concetto si eretico che e non si accostava a qualsi voglia religione stimando per avventura assai piu lo esser filosofo che cristiano see the first edition of le vite but this accusation on the part of a writer in the days of the inquisition is not a very serious one and the less so since throughout the manuscripts we find nothing to support it under the heading of philosophical maxims i have collected all the passages which can give us a clear comprehension of leonardo s ideas of the world at large it is scarcely necessary to observe that there is absolutely nothing in them to lead to the inference that he was an atheist his views of nature and its laws are no doubt very unlike those of his contemporaries and have a much closer affinity to those which find general acceptance at the present day on the other hand it is obvious from leonardo s will see no that in the year before his death he had professed to adhere to the fundamental doctrines of the roman catholic faith and this evidently from his own personal desire and impulse the incredible and demonstrably fictitious legend of leonardo s death in the arms of francis the first is given with others by vasari and further embellished by this odious comment mostrava tuttavia quanto avea offeso dio e gli uomini del mondo non avendo operato nell arte come si conveniva this last accusation it may be remarked is above all evidence of the superficial character of the information which vasari was in a position to give about leonardo it seems to imply that leonardo was disdainful of diligent labour with regard to the second referring to leonardo s morality and dealings with his fellow men vasari himself nullifies it by asserting the very contrary in several passages a further refutation may be found in the following sentence from the letter in which melsi the young milanese nobleman announces the master s death to leonardo s brothers credo siate certificati della morte di maestro lionardo fratello vostro e mio quanto optimo padre per la cui morte sarebbe impossibile che io potesse esprimere il dolore che io ho preso e in mentre che queste mia membra si sosterranno insieme io possedero una perpetua infelicita e meritamente perche sviscerato et ardentissimo amore mi portava giornalmente e dolto ad ognuno la perdita di tal uomo quale non e piu in podesta della natura ecc it is true that in april we find the names of leonardo and verrocchio entered in the libro degli uffiziali di notte e de monasteri as breaking the laws but we immediately after find the note absoluti cum condizione ut retamburentur tamburini was the name given to the warrant cases of the night police the acquittal therefore did not exclude the possibility of a repetition of the charge it was in fact repeated two months later and on this occasion the master and his pupil were again fully acquitted verrocchio was at this time forty and leonardo four and twenty the documents referring to this affair are in the state archives of florence they have been withheld from publication but it seemed to me desirable to give the reader this brief account of the leading facts of the story as the vague hints of it which have recently been made public may have given to the incident an aspect which it had not in reality and which it does not deserve the passages here classed under the head morals reveal leonardo to us as a man whose life and conduct were unfailingly governed by lofty principles and aims he could scarcely have recorded his stern reprobation and unmeasured contempt for men who do nothing useful and strive only for riches if his own life and ambitions had been such as they have so often been misrepresented at a period like that when superstition still exercised unlimited dominion over the minds not merely of the illiterate crowd but of the cultivated and learned classes it was very natural that leonardo s views as to alchemy ghosts magicians and the like should be met with stern reprobation whenever and wherever he may have expressed them this accounts for the argumentative tone of all his utterances on such subjects which i have collected in subdivision iii of this section to these i have added some passages which throw light on leonardo s personal views on the universe they are without exception characterised by a broad spirit of naturalism of which the principles are more strictly applied in his essays on astronomy and still more on physical geography to avoid repetition only such notes on philosophy morals and polemics have been included in this section as occur as independent texts in the original mss several moral reflections have already been given in vol i in section allegorical representations mottoes and emblems others will be found in the following section nos to vol i are also passages of an argumentative character it did not seem requisite to repeat here these and similar passages since their direct connection with the context is far closer in places where they have appeared already than it would be here i philosophical maxims prayers to god i obey thee lord first for the love i ought in all reason to bear thee secondly for that thou canst shorten or prolong the lives of men a prayer thou o god dost sell us all good things at the price of labour the powers of nature o admirable impartiality of thine thou first mover thou hast not permitted that any force should fail of the order or quality of its necessary results necessity is the mistress and guide of nature necessity is the theme and the inventress the eternal curb and law of nature in many cases one and the same thing is attracted by two strong forces namely necessity and potency water falls in rain the earth absorbs it from the necessity for moisture and the sun evaporates it not from necessity but by its power weight force and casual impulse together with resistance are the four external powers in which all the visible actions of mortals have their being and their end our body is dependant on heaven and heaven on the spirit the motive power is the cause of all life psychology and you o man who will discern in this work of mine the wonderful works of nature if you think it would be a criminal thing to destroy it reflect how much more criminal it is to take the life of a man and if this his external form appears to thee marvellously constructed remember that it is nothing as compared with the soul that dwells in that structure for that indeed be it what it may is a thing divine leave it then to dwell in his work at his good will and pleasure and let not your rage or malice destroy a life for indeed he who does not value it does not himself deserve it footnote in ms ii a is the note chi no stima la vita non la merita footnote this text is on the back of the drawings reproduced on pl cvii compare no note on p compare also no and the soul can never be corrupted with the corruption of the body but is in the body as it were the air which causes the sound of the organ where when a pipe bursts the wind would cease to have any good effect footnote compare no the part always has a tendency to reunite with its whole in order to escape from its imperfection the spirit desires to remain with its body because without the organic instruments of that body it can neither act nor feel anything if any one wishes to see how the soul dwells in its body let him observe how this body uses its daily habitation that is to say if this is devoid of order and confused the body will be kept in disorder and confusion by its soul why does the eye see a thing more clearly in dreams than with the imagination being awake the senses are of the earth reason stands apart in contemplation footnote compare no every action needs to be prompted by a motive to know and to will are two operations of the human mind discerning judging deliberating are acts of the human mind all our knowledge has its origin in our preceptions science its principles and rules science is the observation of things possible whether present or past prescience is the knowledge of things which may come to pass though but slowly experience the interpreter between formative nature and the human race teaches how that nature acts among mortals and being constrained by necessity cannot act otherwise than as reason which is its helm requires her to act wisdom is the daughter of experience nature is full of infinite causes that have never occured in experience truth was the only daughter of time experience never errs it is only your judgments that err by promising themselves effects such as are not caused by your experiments experience does not err only your judgments err by expecting from her what is not in her power men wrongly complain of experience with great abuse they accuse her of leading them astray but they set experience aside turning from it with complaints as to our ignorance causing us to be carried away by vain and foolish desires to promise ourselves in her name things that are not in her power saying that she is fallacious men are unjust in complaining of innocent experience constantly accusing her of error and of false evidence instrumental or mechanical science is of all the noblest and the most useful seeing that by means of this all animated bodies that have movement perform all their actions and these movements are based on the centre of gravity which is placed in the middle dividing unequal weights and it has dearth and wealth of muscles and also lever and counterlever of mechanics mechanics are the paradise of mathematical science because here we come to the fruits of mathematics footnote compare no vol i p every instrument requires to be made by experience the man who blames the supreme certainty of mathematics feeds on confusion and can never silence the contradictions of sophistical sciences which lead to an eternal quackery there is no certainty in sciences where one of the mathematical sciences cannot be applied or which are not in relation with these mathematics any one who in discussion relies upon authority uses not his understanding but rather his memory good culture is born of a good disposition and since the cause is more to be praised than the effect i will rather praise a good disposition without culture than good culture without the disposition science is the captain and practice the soldiers of the errors of those who depend on practice without science those who fall in love with practice without science are like a sailor who enters a ship without a helm or a compass and who never can be certain whither he is going ii morals what is life now you see that the hope and the desire of returning home and to one s former state is like the moth to the light and that the man who with constant longing awaits with joy each new spring time each new summer each new month and new year deeming that the things he longs for are ever too late in coming does not perceive that he is longing for his own destruction but this desire is the very quintessence the spirit of the elements which finding itself imprisoned with the soul is ever longing to return from the human body to its giver and you must know that this same longing is that quintessence inseparable from nature and that man is the image of the world o time consumer of all things o envious age thou dost destroy all things and devour all things with the relentless teeth of years little by little in a slow death helen when she looked in her mirror seeing the withered wrinkles made in her face by old age wept and wondered why she had twice been carried away o time consumer of all things and o envious age by which all things are all devoured death every evil leaves behind a grief in our memory except the supreme evil that is death which destroys this memory together with life how to spend life sleepers what a thing is slumber sleep resembles death ah why then dost thou not work in such wise as that after death thou mayst retain a resemblance to perfect life when during life thou art in sleep so like to the hapless dead footnote compare no vol i p one pushes down the other by these square blocks are meant the life and the studies of men the knowledge of past times and of the places on the earth is both an ornament and nutriment to the human mind to lie is so vile that even if it were in speaking well of godly things it would take off something from god s grace and truth is so excellent that if it praises but small things they become noble beyond a doubt truth bears the same relation to falsehood as light to darkness and this truth is in itself so excellent that even when it dwells on humble and lowly matters it is still infinitely above uncertainty and lies disguised in high and lofty discourses because in our minds even if lying should be their fifth element this does not prevent that the truth of things is the chief nutriment of superior intellects though not of wandering wits but you who live in dreams are better pleased by the sophistical reasons and frauds of wits in great and uncertain things than by those reasons which are certain and natural and not so far above us avoid studies of which the result dies with the worker men are in error when they lament the flight of time accusing it of being too swift and not perceiving that it is sufficient as it passes but good memory with which nature has endowed us causes things long past to seem present learning acquired in youth arrests the evil of old age and if you understand that old age has wisdom for its food you will so conduct yourself in youth that your old age will not lack for nourishment the acquisition of any knowledge is always of use to the intellect because it may thus drive out useless things and retain the good for nothing can be loved or hated unless it is first known as a day well spent procures a happy sleep so a life well employed procures a happy death the water you touch in a river is the last of that which has passed and the first of that which is coming thus it is with time present life if well spent is long just as food eaten without caring for it is turned into loathsome nourishment so study without a taste for it spoils memory by retaining nothing which it has taken in just as eating against one s will is injurious to health so study without a liking for it spoils the memory and it retains nothing it takes in on mount etna the words freeze in your mouth and you may make ice of them footnote there is no clue to explain this strange sentence just as iron rusts unless it is used and water putrifies or in cold turns to ice so our intellect spoils unless it is kept in use you do ill if you praise and still worse if you reprove in a matter you do not understand when fortune comes seize her in front with a sure hand because behind she is bald it seems to me that men of coarse and clumsy habits and of small knowledge do not deserve such fine instruments nor so great a variety of natural mechanism as men of speculation and of great knowledge but merely a sack in which their food may be stowed and whence it may issue since they cannot be judged to be any thing else than vehicles for food for it seems to me they have nothing about them of the human species but the voice and the figure and for all the rest are much below beasts some there are who are nothing else than a passage for food and augmentors of excrement and fillers of privies because through them no other things in the world nor any good effects are produced since nothing but full privies results from them on foolishness and ignorance the greatest deception men suffer is from their own opinions folly is the shield of shame as unreadiness is that of poverty glorified blind ignorance misleads us thus and delights with the results of lascivious joys because it does not know the true light because it does not know what is the true light vain splendour takes from us the power of being behold for its vain splendour we go into the fire thus blind ignorance does mislead us that is blind ignorance so misleads us that o wretched mortals open your eyes on riches that is not riches which may be lost virtue is our true good and the true reward of its possessor that cannot be lost that never deserts us but when life leaves us as to property and external riches hold them with trembling they often leave their possessor in contempt and mocked at for having lost them every man wishes to make money to give it to the doctors destroyers of life they then ought to be rich footnote compare no man has much power of discourse which for the most part is vain and false animals have but little but it is useful and true and a small truth is better than a great lie he who possesses most must be most afraid of loss he who wishes to be rich in a day will be hanged in a year that man is of supreme folly who always wants for fear of wanting and his life flies away while he is still hoping to enjoy the good things which he has with extreme labour acquired rules of life if you governed your body by the rules of virtue you would not walk on all fours in this world you grow

great martyr the memory of benefits is a frail defence against ingratitude reprove your friend in secret and praise him openly be not false about the past a simile for patience patience serves us against insults precisely as clothes do against the cold for if you multiply your garments as the cold increases that cold cannot hurt you in the same way increase your patience under great offences and they cannot hurt your feelings to speak well of a base man is much the same as speaking ill of a good man envy wounds with false accusations that is with detraction a thing which scares virtue we are deceived by promises and time disappoints us footnote the rest of this passage may be rendered in various ways but none of them give a satisfactory meaning fear arises sooner than any thing else just as courage imperils life fear protects it threats alone are the weapons of the threatened man wherever good fortune enters envy lays siege to the place and attacks it and when it departs sorrow and repentance remain behind he who walks straight rarely falls it is bad if you praise and worse if you reprove a thing i mean if you do not understand the matter well it is ill to praise and worse to reprimand in matters that you do not understand words which do not satisfy the ear of the hearer weary him or vex him and the symptoms of this you will often see in such hearers in their frequent yawns you therefore who speak before men whose good will you desire when you see such an excess of fatigue abridge your speech or change your discourse and if you do otherwise then instead of the favour you desire you will get dislike and hostility and if you would see in what a man takes pleasure without hearing him speak change the subject of your discourse in talking to him and when you presently see him intent without yawning or wrinkling his brow or other actions of various kinds you may be certain that the matter of which you are speaking is such as is agreeable to him c the lover

of your folly and then with the crowd of sophists you deceive yourselves and others despising the mathematical sciences in which truth dwells and the knowledge of the things included in them and then you occupy yourself with miracles and write that you possess information of those things of which the human mind is incapable and which cannot be proved by any instance from nature and you fancy you

light on this error the spirit has no voice because where there is a voice there is a body and where there is a body space is occupied and this prevents the eye from seeing what is placed behind that space hence the surrounding air is filled by the body that is by its image there can be no voice where there is no motion or percussion of the air there can be no percussion of the air where there is no instrument there can be no instrument without a body and this being so a spirit can have neither voice nor form nor strength and if it were to assume a body it could not penetrate nor enter where the passages are closed and if any one should say that by air compressed and compacted together a spirit may take bodies of various forms and by this means speak and move with strength to him i reply that when there are neither nerves nor bones there can be no force exercised in any kind of movement made by such imaginary spirits beware of the teaching of these speculators because their reasoning is not confirmed by experience of all human opinions that is to be reputed the most foolish which deals with the belief in necromancy the sister of alchemy which gives birth to simple and natural things but it is all the more worthy of reprehension than alchemy because it brings forth nothing but what is like itself that is lies this does not happen in alchemy which deals with simple products of nature and whose function cannot be exercised by nature itself because it has no organic instruments with which it can work as men do by means of their hands who have produced for instance glass c but this necromancy the flag and flying banner blown by the winds is the guide of the stupid crowd which is constantly witness to the dazzling and endless effects of this art and there are books full declaring that enchantments and spirits can work and speak without tongues and without organic instruments without which it is impossible to speak and can carry heaviest weights and raise storms and rain and that men can be turned into cats and wolves and other beasts although indeed it is those who affirm these things who first became beasts and surely if this necromancy did exist as is believed by small wits there is nothing on the earth that would be of so much importance alike for the detriment and service of men if it were true that there were in such an art a power to disturb the calm serenity of the air converting it into darkness and making coruscations or winds with terrific thunder and lightnings rushing through the darkness and with violent storms overthrowing high buildings and rooting up forests and thus to oppose armies crushing and annihilating them and besides these frightful storms may deprive the peasants of the reward of their labours now what kind of warfare is there to hurt the enemy so much as to deprive him of the harvest what naval warfare could be compared with this i say the man who has power to command the winds and to make ruinous gales by which any fleet may be submerged surely a man who could command such violent forces would be lord of the nations and no human ingenuity could resist his crushing force the hidden treasures and gems reposing in the body of the earth would all be made manifest to him no lock nor fortress though impregnable would be able to save any one against the will of the necromancer he would have himself carried through the air from east to west and through all the opposite sides of the universe but why should i enlarge further upon this what is there that could not be done by such a craftsman almost nothing except to escape death hereby i have explained in part the mischief and the usefulness contained in this art if it is real and if it is real why has it not remained among men who desire it so much having nothing to do with any deity for i know that there are numberless people who would to satisfy a whim destroy god and all the universe and if this necromancy being as it were so necessary to men has not been left among them it can never have existed nor will it ever exist according to the definition of the spirit which is invisible in substance for within the elements there are no incorporate things because where there is no body there is a vacuum and no vacuum can exist in the elements because it would be immediately filled up turn over of spirits we have said on the other side of this page that the definition of a spirit is a power conjoined to a body because it cannot move of its own accord nor can it have any kind of motion in space and if you were to say that it moves itself this cannot be within the elements for if the spirit is an incorporeal quantity this quantity is called a vacuum and a vacuum does not exist in nature and granting that one were formed it would be immediately filled up by the rushing in of the element in which the vacuum had been generated therefore from the definition of weight which is this gravity is an accidental power created by one element being drawn to or suspended in another it follows that an element not weighing anything compared with itself has weight in the element above it and lighter than it as we see that the parts of water have no gravity or levity compared with other water but if you draw it up into the air then it would acquire weight and if you were to draw the air beneath the water then the water which remains above this air would acquire weight which weight could not sustain itself by itself whence collapse is inevitable and this happens in water wherever the vacuum may be in this water it will fall in and this would happen with a spirit amid the elements where it would continuously generate a vacuum in whatever element it might find itself whence it would be inevitable that it should be constantly flying towards the sky until it had quitted these elements as to whether a spirit has a body amid the elements we have proved that a spirit cannot exist of itself amid the elements without a body nor can it move of itself by voluntary motion unless it be to rise upwards but now we will say how such a spirit taking an aerial body would be inevitably melt into air because if it remained united it would be separated and fall to form a vacuum as is said above therefore it is inevitable if it is to be able to remain suspended in the air that it should absorb a certain quantity of air and if it were mingled with the air two difficulties arise that is to say it must rarefy that portion of the air with which it mingles and for this cause the rarefied air must fly up of itself and will not remain among the air that is heavier than itself and besides this the subtle spiritual essence disunites itself and its nature is modified by which that nature loses some of its first virtue added to these there is a third difficulty and this is that such a body formed of air assumed by the spirits is exposed to the penetrating winds which are incessantly sundering and dispersing the united portions of the air revolving and whirling amidst the rest of the atmosphere therefore the spirit which is infused in this air would be dismembered or rent and broken up with the rending of the air into which it was incorporated as to whether the spirit having taken this body of air can move of itself or not it is impossible that the spirit infused into a certain quantity of air should move this air and this is proved by the above passage where it is said the spirit rarefies that portion of the air in which it incorporates itself therefore this air will rise high above the other air and there will be a motion of the air caused by its lightness and not by a voluntary movement of the spirit and if this air is encountered by the wind according to the rd of this the air will be moved by the wind and not by the spirit incorporated in it as to whether the spirit can speak or not in order to prove whether the spirit can speak or not it is necessary in the first place to define what a voice is and how it is generated and we will say that the voice is as it were the movement of air in friction against a dense body or a dense body in friction against the air which is the same thing and this friction of the dense and the rare condenses the rare and causes resistance again the rare when in swift motion and the rare in slow motion condense each other when they come in contact and make a noise and very great uproar and the sound or murmur made by the rare moving through the rare with only moderate swiftness like a great flame generating noises in the air and the tremendous uproar made by the rare mingling with the rare and when that air which is both swift and rare rushes into that which is itself rare and in motion it is like the flame of fire which issues from a big gun and striking against the air and again when a flame issues from the cloud there is a concussion in the air as the bolt is generated therefore we may say that the spirit cannot produce a voice without movement of the air and air in it there is none nor can it emit what it has not and if desires to move that air in which it is incorporated it is necessary that the spirit should multiply itself and that cannot multiply which has no quantity and in the th place it is said that no rare body can move if it has not a stable spot whence it may take its motion much more is it so when an element has to move within its own element which does not move of itself excepting by uniform evaporation at the centre of the thing evaporated as occurs in a sponge squeezed in the hand held under water the water escapes in every direction with equal movement through the openings between the fingers of the hand in which it is squeezed as to whether the spirit has an articulate voice and whether the spirit can be heard and what hearing is and seeing the wave of the voice passes through the air as the images of objects pass to the eye nonentity every quantity is intellectually conceivable as infinitely divisible amid the vastness of the things among which we live the existence of nothingness holds the first place its function extends over all things that have no existence and its essence as regards time lies precisely between the past and the future and has nothing in the present this nothingness has the part equal to the whole and the whole to the part the divisible to the indivisible and the product of the sum is the same whether we divide or multiply and in addition as in subtraction as is proved by arithmeticians by their tenth figure which represents zero and its power has not extension among the things of nature what is called nothingness is to be found only in time and in speech in time it stands between the past and future and has no existence in the present and thus in speech it is one of the things of which we say they are not or they are impossible with regard to time nothingness lies between the past and the future and has nothing to do with the present and as to its nature it is to be classed among things impossible hence from what has been said it has no existence because where there is nothing there would necessarily be a vacuum footnote compare no reflections on nature example of the lightning in clouds o mighty and once living instrument of formative nature incapable of availing thyself of thy vast strength thou hast to abandon a life of stillness and to obey the law which god and time gave to procreative nature ah how many a time the shoals of terrified dolphins and the huge tunny fish were seen to flee before thy cruel fury to escape whilst thy fulminations raised in the sea a sudden tempest with buffeting and submersion of ships in the great waves and filling the uncovered shores with the terrified and desperate fishes which fled from thee and left by the sea remained in spots where they became the abundant prey of the people in the neighbourhood o time swift robber of all created things how many kings how many nations hast thou undone and how many changes of states and of various events have happened since the wondrous forms of this fish perished here in this cavernous and winding recess now destroyed by time thou liest patiently in this confined space with bones stripped and bare serving as a support and prop for the superimposed mountain footnote the character of the handwriting points to an early period of leonardo s life it has become very indistinct and is at present exceedingly difficult to decipher some passages remain doubtful footnote compare no written on the same sheet the watery element was left enclosed between the raised banks of the rivers and the sea was seen between the uplifted earth and the surrounding air which has to envelope and enclose the complicated machine of the earth and whose mass standing between the water and the element of fire remained much restricted and deprived of its indispensable moisture the rivers will be deprived of their waters the fruitful earth will put forth no more her light verdure the fields will no more be decked with waving corn all the animals finding no fresh grass for pasture will die and food will then be lacking to the lions and wolves and other beasts of prey and to men who after many efforts will be compelled to abandon their life and the human race will die out in this way the fertile and fruitful earth will remain deserted arid and sterile from the water being shut up in its interior and from the activity of nature it will continue a little time to increase until the cold and subtle air being gone it will be forced to end with the element of fire and then its surface will be left burnt up to cinder and this will be the end of all terrestrial nature footnote compare no written on the same sheet why did nature not ordain that one animal should not live by the death of another nature being inconstant and taking pleasure in creating and making constantly new lives and forms because she knows that her terrestrial materials become thereby augmented is more ready and more swift in her creating than time in his destruction and so she has ordained that many animals shall be food for others nay this not satisfying her desire to the same end she frequently sends forth certain poisonous and pestilential vapours upon the vast increase and congregation of animals and most of all upon men who increase vastly because other animals do not feed upon them and the causes being removed the effects would not follow this earth therefore seeks to lose its life desiring only continual reproduction and as by the argument you bring forward and demonstrate like effects always follow like causes animals are the image of the world xx humorous writings just as michaelangelo s occasional poems reflect his private life as well as the general disposition of his mind we may find in the writings collected in this section the transcript of leonardo s fanciful nature and we should probably not be far wrong in assuming that he himself had recited these fables in the company of his friends or at the court festivals of princes and patrons era tanto piacevole nella conversazione so relates vasari che tirava a se gli animi delle genti and paulus jovius says in his short biography of the artist fuit ingenio valde comi nitido liberali vultu autem longe venustissimo et cum elegantiae omnis deliciarumque maxime theatralium mirificus inventor ac arbiter esset ad lyramque scito caneret cunctis per omnem aetatem principibus mire placuit there can be no doubt that the fables are the original offspring of leonardo s brain and not borrowed from any foreign source indeed the schemes and plans for the composition of fables collected in division v seem to afford an external proof of this if the fables themselves did not render it self evident several of them for instance no l are so strikingly characteristic of leonardo s views of natural science that we cannot do them justice till we are acquainted with his theories on such subjects and this is equally true of the prophecies i have prefixed to these quaint writings the studies on the life and habits of animals which are singular from their peculiar aphoristic style and i have transcribed them in exactly the order in which they are written in ms h this is one of the very rare instances in which one subject is treated in a consecutive series of notes all in one ms and leonardo has also departed from his ordinary habits by occasionally not completing the text on the page it is begun these brief notes of a somewhat mysterious bearing have been placed here simply because they may possibly have been intended to serve as hints for fables or allegories they can scarcely be regarded as preparatory for a natural history rather they would seem to be extracts on the one hand the names of some of the animals seem to prove that leonardo could not here be recording observations of his own on the other hand the notes on their habits and life appear to me to dwell precisely on what must have interested him most so far as it is possible to form any complete estimate of his nature and tastes in no lines we have a sketch of a scheme for grouping the prophecies i have not however availed myself of it as a clue to their arrangement here because in the first place the texts are not so numerous as to render the suggested classification useful to the reader and also because in reading the long series as they occur in the original we may follow the author s mind and here and there it is not difficult to see how one theme suggested another i have however regarded leonardo s scheme for the classification of the prophecies as available for that of the fables and jests and have adhered to it as far as possible among the humourous writings i might perhaps have included the rebusses of which there are several in the collection of leonardo s drawings at windsor it seems to me not likely that many or all of them could be solved at the present day and the mss throw no light on them nor should i be justified if i intended to include in the literary works the well known caricatures of human faces attributed to leonardo of which however it may be incidentally observed the greater number are in my opinion undoubtedly spurious two only have necessarily been given owing to their presence in text which it was desired to reproduce vol i page and pl cxxii it can scarcely be doubted that some satirical intention is conveyed by the drawing on pl lxiv text no my reason for not presenting leonardo to the reader as a poet is the fact that the maxims and morals in verse which have been ascribed to him are not to be found in the manuscripts and prof uzielli has already proved that they cannot be by him hence it would seem that only a few short verses can be attributed to him with any certainty i studies on the life and habits of animals the love of virtue the gold finch is a bird of which it is related that when it is carried into the presence of a sick person if the sick man is going to die the bird turns away its head and never looks at him but if the sick man is to be saved the bird never loses sight of him but is the cause of curing him of all his sickness like unto this is the love of virtue it never looks at any vile or base thing but rather clings always to pure and virtuous things and takes up its abode in a noble heart as the birds do in green woods on flowery branches and this love shows itself more in adversity than in prosperity as light does which shines most where the place is darkest envy we read of the kite that when it sees its young ones growing too big in the nest out of envy it pecks their sides and keeps them without food cheerfulness cheerfulness is proper to the cock which rejoices over every little thing and crows with varied and lively movements sadness sadness resembles the raven which when it sees its young ones born white departs in great grief and abandons them with doleful lamentations and does not feed them until it sees in them some few black feathers peace we read of the beaver that when it is pursued knowing that it is for the virtue contained in its medicinal testicles and not being able to escape it stops and to be at peace with its pursuers it bites off its testicles with its sharp teeth and leaves them to its enemies rage it is said of the bear that when it goes to the haunts of bees to take their honey the bees having begun to sting him he leaves the honey and rushes to revenge himself and as he seeks to be revenged on all those that sting him he is revenged on none in such wise that his rage is turned to madness and he flings himself on the ground vainly exasperating by his hands and feet the foes against which he is defending himself gratitude the virtue of gratitude is said to be more developed in the birds called hoopoes which knowing the benefits of life and food they have received from their father and their mother when they see them grow old make a nest for them and brood over them and feed them and with their beaks pull out their old and shabby feathers and then with a certain herb restore their sight so that they return to a prosperous state avarice the toad feeds on earth and always remains lean because it never eats enough it is so afraid lest it should want for earth ingratitude pigeons are a symbol of ingratitude for when they are old enough no longer to need to be fed they begin to fight with their father and this struggle does not end until the young one drives the father out and takes the hen and makes her his own cruelty the basilisk is so utterly cruel that when it cannot kill animals by its baleful gaze it turns upon herbs and plants and fixing its gaze on them withers them up generosity it is said of the eagle that it is never so hungry but that it will leave a part of its prey for the birds that are round it which being unable to provide their own food are necessarily dependent on the eagle since it is thus that they obtain food discipline when the wolf goes cunningly round some stable of cattle and by accident puts his foot in a trap so that he makes a noise he bites his foot off to punish himself for his folly flatterers or syrens the syren sings so sweetly that she lulls the mariners to sleep then she climbs upon the ships and kills the sleeping mariners prudence the ant by her natural foresight provides in the summer for the winter killing the seeds she harvests that they may not germinate and on them in due time she feeds folly the wild bull having a horror of a red colour the hunters dress up the trunk of a tree with red and the bull runs at this with great frenzy thus fixing his horns and forthwith the hunters kill him there justice we may liken the virtue of justice to the king of the bees which orders and arranges every thing with judgment for some bees are ordered to go to the flowers others are ordered to labour others to fight with the wasps others to clear away all dirt others to accompagny and escort the king and when he is old and has no wings they carry him and if one of them fails in his duty he is punished without reprieve truth although partridges steal each other s eggs nevertheless the young born of these eggs always return to their true mother fidelity or loyalty the cranes are so faithful and loyal to their king that at night when he is sleeping some of them go round the field to keep watch at a distance others remain near each holding a stone in his foot so that if sleep should overcome them this stone would fall and make so much noise that they would wake up again and there are others which sleep together round the king and this they do every night changing in turn so that their king may never find them wanting falsehood the fox when it sees a flock of herons or magpies or birds of that kind suddenly flings himself on the ground with his mouth open to look as he were dead and these birds want to peck at his tongue and he bites off their heads lies the mole has very small eyes and it always lives under ground and it lives as long as it is in the dark but when it comes into the light it dies immediately because it becomes known and so it is with lies valour the lion is never afraid but rather fights with a bold spirit and savage onslaught against a multitude of hunters always seeking to injure the first that injures him fear or cowardice the hare is always frightened and the leaves that fall from the trees in autumn always keep him in terror and generally put him to flight magnanimity the falcon never preys but on large birds and it will let itself die rather than feed on little ones or eat stinking meat vain glory as regards this vice we read that the peacock is more guilty of it than any other animal for it is always contemplating the beauty of its tail which it spreads in the form of a wheel and by its cries attracts to itself the gaze of the creatures that surround it and this is the last vice to be conquered constancy constancy may be symbolised by the phoenix which knowing that by nature it must be resuscitated has the constancy to endure the burning flames which consume it and then it rises anew inconstancy the swallow may serve for inconstancy for it is always in movement since it cannot endure the smallest discomfort continence the camel is the most lustful animal there is and will follow the female for a thousand miles but if you keep it constantly with its mother or sister it will leave them alone so temperate is its nature incontinence the unicorn through its intemperance and not knowing how to control itself for the love it bears to fair maidens forgets its ferocity and wildness and laying aside all fear it will go up to a seated damsel and go to sleep in her lap and thus the hunters take it humility we see the most striking example of humility in the lamb which will submit to any animal and when they are given for food to imprisoned lions they are as gentle to them as to their own mother so that very often it has been seen that the lions forbear to kill them pride the falcon by reason of its haughtiness and pride is fain to lord it and rule over all the other birds of prey and longs to be sole and supreme and very often the falcon has been seen to assault the eagle the queen of birds abstinence the wild ass when it goes to the well to drink and finds the water troubled is never so thirsty but that it will abstain from drinking and wait till the water is clear again gluttony the vulture is so addicted to gluttony that it will go a thousand miles to eat a carrion carcase therefore is it that it follows armies chastity the turtle dove is never false to its mate and if one dies the other preserves perpetual chastity and never again sits on a green bough nor ever again drinks of clear water unchastity the bat owing to unbridled lust observes no universal rule in pairing but males with males and females with females pair promiscuously as it may happen moderation the ermine out of moderation never eats but once in the day it will rather let itself be taken by the hunters than take refuge in a dirty lair in order not to stain its purity the eagle the eagle when it is old flies so high that it scorches its feathers and nature allowing that it should renew its youth it falls into shallow water footnote the meaning is obscure and if its young ones cannot bear to gaze on the sun footnote the meaning is obscure it does not feed them with any bird that does not wish to die animals which much fear it do not approach its nest although it does not hurt them it always leaves part of its prey uneaten lumerpa fame this is found in asia major and shines so brightly that it absorbs its own shadow and when it dies it does not lose this light and its feathers never fall out but a feather pulled out shines no longer the pelican this bird has a great love for its young and when it finds them in its nest dead from a serpent s bite it pierces itself to the heart and with its blood it bathes them till they return to life the salamander this has no digestive organs and gets no food but from the fire in which it constantly renews its scaly skin the salamander which renews its scaly skin in the fire for virtue the cameleon this lives on air and there it is the prey of all the birds so in order to be safer it flies above the clouds and finds an air so rarefied that it cannot support the bird that follows it at that height nothing can go unless it has a gift from heaven and that is where the chameleon flies the alepo a fish the fish alepo does not live out of water the ostrich this bird converts iron into nourishment and hatches its eggs by its gaze armies under commanders the swan the swan is white without any spot and it sings sweetly as it dies its life ending with that song the stork this bird by drinking saltwater purges itself of distempers if the male finds his mate unfaithful he abandons her and when it grows old its young ones brood over it and feed it till it dies the grasshopper this silences the cuckoo with its song it dies in oil and revives in vinegar it sings in the greatest heats the bat the more light there is the blinder this creature becomes as those who gaze most at the sun become most dazzled for vice that cannot remain where virtue appears the partridge this bird changes from the female into the male and forgets its former sex and out of envy it steals the eggs from others and hatches them but the young ones follow the true mother the swallow this bird gives sight to its blind young ones by means of celandine the oyster for treachery this creature when the moon is full opens itself wide and when the crab looks in he throws in a piece of rock or seaweed and the oyster cannot close again whereby it serves for food to that crab this is what happens to him who opens his mouth to tell his secret he becomes the prey of the treacherous hearer the basilisk cruelty all snakes flie from this creature but the weasel attacks it by means of rue and kills it the asp this carries instantaneous death in its fangs and that it may not hear the charmer it stops its ears with its tail the dragon this creature entangles itself in the legs of the elephant which falls upon it and so both die and in its death it is avenged the viper she in pairing opens her mouth and at last clenches her teeth and kills her husband then the young ones growing within her body rend her open and kill their mother the scorpion saliva spit out when fasting will kill a scorpion this may be likened to abstinence from greediness which removes and heals the ills which result from that gluttony and opens the path of virtue the crocodile hypocrisy this animal catches a man and straightway kills him after he is dead it weeps for him with a lamentable voice and many tears then having done lamenting it cruelly devours him it is thus with the hypocrite who for the smallest matter has his face bathed with tears but shows the heart of a tiger and rejoices in his heart at the woes of others while wearing a pitiful face the toad the toad flies from the light of the sun and if it is held there by force it puffs itself out so much as to hide its head below and shield itself from the rays thus does the foe of clear and radiant virtue who can only be constrainedly brought to face it with puffed up courage the caterpillar for virtue in general the caterpillar which by means of assiduous care is able to weave round itself a new dwelling place with marvellous artifice and fine workmanship comes out of it afterwards with painted and lovely wings with which it rises towards heaven the spider the spider brings forth out of herself the delicate and ingenious web which makes her a return by the prey it takes footnote two notes are underneath this text the first nessuna chosa e da ttemere piu che lla sozza fama is a repetition of the first line of the text given in vol i no the second faticha fugga cholla fama in braccio quasi ochultata c is written in red chalk and is evidently an incomplete sentence the lion this animal with his thundering roar rouses his young the third day after they are born teaching them the use of all their dormant senses and all the wild things which are in the wood flee away this may be compared to the children of virtue who are roused by the sound of praise and grow up in honourable studies by which they are more and more elevated while all that is base flies at the sound shunning those who are virtuous again the lion covers over its foot tracks so that the way it has gone may not be known to its enemies thus it beseems a captain to conceal the secrets of his mind so that the enemy may not know his purpose the tarantula the bite of the tarantula fixes a man s mind on one idea that is on the thing he was thinking of when he was bitten the screech owl and the owl these punish those who are scoffing at them by pecking out their eyes for nature has so ordered it that they may thus be fed the elephant the huge elephant has by nature what is rarely found in man that is honesty prudence justice and the observance of religion inasmuch as when the moon is new these beasts go down to the rivers and there solemnly cleansing themselves they bathe and so having saluted the planet return to the woods and when they are ill being laid down they fling up plants towards heaven as though they would offer sacrifice they bury their tusks when they fall out from old age of these two tusks they use one to dig up roots for food but they save the point of the other for fighting with when they are taken by hunters and when worn out by fatigue they dig up these buried tusks and ransom themselves they are merciful and know the dangers and if one finds a man alone and lost he kindly puts him back in the road he has missed if he finds the footprints of the man before the man himself it dreads betrayal so it stops and blows pointing it out to the other elephants who form in a troop and go warily these beasts always go in troops and the oldest goes in front and the second in age remains the last and thus they enclose the troop out of shame they pair only at night and secretly nor do they then rejoin the herd but first bathe in the river the females do not fight as with other animals and it is so merciful that it is most unwilling by nature ever to hurt those weaker than itself and if it meets in the middle of its way a flock of sheep it puts them aside with its trunk so as not to trample them under foot and it never hurts any thing unless when provoked when one has fallen into a pit the others fill up the pit with branches earth and stones thus raising the bottom that he may easily get out they greatly dread the noise of swine and fly in confusion doing no less harm then with their feet to their own kind than to the enemy they delight in rivers and are always wandering about near them though on account of their great weight they cannot swim they devour stones and the trunks of trees are their favourite food they have a horror of rats flies delight in their smell and settle on their back and the beast scrapes its skin making its folds even and kills them when they cross rivers they send their young ones up against the stream of the water thus being set towards the fall they break the united current of the water so that the current does not carry them away the dragon flings itself under the elephant s body and with its tail it ties its legs with its wings and with its arms it also clings round its ribs and cuts its throat with its teeth and the elephant falls upon it and the dragon is burst thus in its death it is revenged on its foe the dragon these go in companies together and they twine themselves after the manner of roots and with their heads raised they cross lakes and swim to where they find better pasture and if they did not thus combine they would be drowned therefore they combine the serpent the serpent is a very large animal when it sees a bird in the air it draws in its breath so strongly that it draws the birds into its mouth too marcus regulus the consul of the roman army was attacked with his army by such an animal and almost defeated and this animal being killed by a catapult measured feet that is braccia and its head was high above all the trees in a wood the boa this is a very large snake which entangles itself round the legs of the cow so that it cannot move and then sucks it in such wise that it almost dries it up in the time of claudius the emperor there was killed on the vatican hill one which had inside it a boy entire that it had swallowed the macli caught when asleep this beast is born in scandinavia it has the shape of a great horse excepting that the great length of its neck and of its ears make a difference it feeds on grass going backwards for it has so long an upper lip that if it went forwards it would cover up the grass its legs are all in one piece for this reason when it wants to sleep it leans against a tree and the hunters spying out the place where it is wont to sleep saw the tree almost through and then when it leans against it to sleep in its sleep it falls and thus the hunters take it and every other mode of taking it is in vain because it is incredibly swift in running the bison which does injury in its flight this beast is a native of paeonia and has a neck with a mane like a horse in all its other parts it is like a bull excepting that its horns are in a way bent inwards so that it cannot butt hence it has no safety but in flight in which it flings out its excrement to a distance of braccia in its course and this burns like fire wherever it touches lions pards panthers tigers these keep their claws in the sheath and never put them out unless they are on the back of their prey or their enemy the lioness when the lioness defends her young from the hand of the hunter in order not to be frightened by the spears she keeps her eyes on the ground to the end that she may not by her flight leave her young ones prisoners the lion this animal which is so terrible fears nothing more than the noise of empty carts and likewise the crowing of cocks and it is much terrified at the sight of one and looks at its comb with a frightened aspect and is strangely alarmed when its face is covered the panther in africa this has the form of the lioness but it is taller on its legs and slimmer and long bodied and it is all white and marked with black spots after the manner of rosettes and all animals delight to look upon these rosettes and they would always be standing round it if it were not for the terror of its face therefore knowing this it hides its face and the surrounding animals grow bold and come close the better to enjoy the sight of so much beauty when suddenly it seizes the nearest and at once devours it camels the bactrian have two humps the arabian one only they are swift in battle and most useful to carry burdens this animal is extremely observant of rule and measure for it will not move if it has a greater weight than it is used to and if it is taken too far it does the same and suddenly stops and so the merchants are obliged to lodge there the tiger this beast is a native of hyrcania and it is something like the panther from the various spots on its skin it is an animal of terrible swiftness the hunter when he finds its young ones carries them off hastily placing mirrors in the place whence he takes them and at once escapes on a swift horse the panther returning finds the mirrors fixed on the ground and looking into them believes it sees its young then scratching with its paws it discovers the cheat forthwith by means of the scent of its young it follows the hunter and when this hunter sees the tigress he drops one of the young ones and she takes it and having carried it to the den she immediately returns to the hunter and does the same till he gets into his boat catoblepas it is found in ethiopia near to the source nigricapo it is not a very large animal is sluggish in all its parts and its head is so large that it carries it with difficulty in such wise that it always droops towards the ground otherwise it would be a great pest to man for any one on whom it fixes its eyes dies immediately footnote leonardo undoubtedly derived these remarks as to the catoblepas from pliny hist nat viii al apud hesperios aethiopas fons est nigris different readings ut plerique existimavere nili caput juxta hunc

an gives a far more minute description of the creature but he says that it poisons beasts not by its gaze but by its venomous breath athenaeus b mentions both if leonardo had known of these two passages he would scarcely have omitted the poisonous breath h muller strubing the basilisk this is found in the province of cyrenaica and is not more than fingers long it has on its head a white spot after the fashion of a diadem it scares all serpents with its whistling it resembles a snake but does not move by wriggling but from the centre forwards to the right it is said that one of these being killed with a spear by one who was on horse back and its venom flowing on the spear not only the man but the horse also died it spoils the wheat and not only that which it touches but where it breathes the grass dries and the stones are split the weasel this beast finding the lair of the basilisk kills it with the smell of its urine and this smell indeed often kills the weasel itself the cerastes this has four movable little horns so when it wants to feed it hides under leaves all of its body except these little horns which as they move seem to the birds to be some small worms at play then they immediately swoop down to pick them and the cerastes suddenly twines round them and encircles and devours them the amphisboena this has two heads one in its proper place the other at the tail as if one place were not enough from which to fling its venom the iaculus this lies on trees and flings itself down like a dart and pierces through the wild beast and kills them the asp the bite of this animal cannot be cured unless by immediately cutting out the bitten part this pestilential animal has such a love for its mate that they always go in company and if by mishap one of them is killed the other with incredible swiftness follows him who has killed it and it is so determined and eager for vengeance that it overcomes every difficulty and passing by every troop it seeks to hurt none but its enemy and it will travel any distance and it is impossible to avoid it unless by crossing water and by very swift flight it has its eyes turned inwards and large ears and it hears better than it sees the ichneumon this animal is the mortal enemy of the asp it is a native of egypt and when it sees an asp near its place it runs at once to the bed or mud of the nile and with this makes itself muddy all over then it dries itself in the sun smears itself again with mud and thus drying one after the other it makes itself three or four coatings like a coat of mail then it attacks the asp and fights well with him so that taking its time it catches him in the throat and destroys him the crocodile this is found in the nile it has four feet and lives on land and in water no other terrestrial creature but this is found to have no tongue and it only bites by moving its upper jaw it grows to a length of forty feet and has claws and is armed with a hide that will take any blow by day it is on land and at night in the water it feeds on fishes and going to sleep on the bank of the nile with its mouth open a bird called trochilus a very small bird runs at once to its mouth and hops among its teeth and goes pecking out the remains of the food and so inciting it with voluptuous delight tempts it to open the whole of its mouth and so it sleeps this being observed by the ichneumon it flings itself into its mouth and perforates its stomach and bowels and finally kills it the dolphin nature has given such knowledge to animals that besides the consciousness of their own advantages they know the disadvantages of their foes thus the dolphin understands what strength lies in a cut from the fins placed on his chine and how tender is the belly of the crocodile hence in fighting with him it thrusts at him from beneath and rips up his belly and so kills him the crocodile is a terror to those that flee and a base coward to those that pursue him the hippopotamus this beast when it feels itself over full goes about seeking thorns or where there may be the remains of canes that have been split and it rubs against them till a vein is opened then when the blood has flowed as much as he needs he plasters himself with mud and heals the wound in form he is something like a horse with long haunches a twisted tail and the teeth of a wild boar his neck has a mane the skin cannot be pierced unless when he is bathing he feeds on plants in the fields and goes into them backwards so that it may seem as though he had come out the ibis this bird resembles a crane and

takes the colour of the thing on which it is resting whence it is often devoured together with the leaves on which the elephant feeds the raven when it has killed the chameleon it takes laurel as a purge moderation checks all the vices the ermine will die rather than besmirch itself of foresight the cock does not crow till it has thrice flapped its wings the parrot in moving among boughs never puts its feet excepting where it has first put its beak vows are not made till hope is dead motion tends towards the centre of gravity magnanimity the falcon never seizes any but large birds and will

take him to the sea the rat purposing to eat him bid him open but as he bit him the oyster squeezed his head and closed and the cat came and killed him a fable the thrushes rejoiced greatly at seeing a man take the owl and deprive her of liberty tying her feet with strong bonds but this owl was afterwards by means of bird lime the cause of the thrushes losing not only their liberty but their life this is said for those countries which rejoice in seeing their governors lose their liberty when by that means they themselves lose all succour and remain in bondage in the power of their enemies losing their liberty and often their life a fable a dog lying asleep on the fur of a sheep one of his fleas perceiving the odour of the greasy wool judged that this must be a land of better living and also more secure from the teeth and nails of the dog than where he fed on the dog and without farther reflection he left the dog and went into the thick wool there he began with great labour to try to pass among the roots of the hairs but after much sweating had to give up the task as vain because these hairs were so close that they almost touched each other and there was no space where fleas could taste the skin hence after much labour and fatigue he began to wish to return to his dog who however had already departed so he was constrained after long repentance and bitter tears to die of hunger a fable the vain and wandering butterfly not content with being able to fly at its ease through the air overcome by the tempting flame of the candle decided to fly into it but its sportive impulse was the cause of a sudden fall for its delicate wings were burnt in the flame and the hapless butterfly having dropped all scorched at the foot of the candlestick after much lamentation and repentance dried the tears from its swimming eyes and raising its face exclaimed o false light how many must thou have miserably deceived in the past like me or if i must indeed see light so near ought i not to have known the sun from the false glare of dirty tallow a fable the monkey finding a nest of small birds went up to it greatly delighted but they being already fledged he could only succeed in taking the smallest greatly delighted he took it in his hand and went to his abode and having begun to look at the little bird he took to kissing it and from excess of love he kissed it so much and turned it about and squeezed it till he killed it this is said for those who by not punishing their children let them come to mischief a fable a rat was besieged in his little dwelling by a weasel which with unwearied vigilance awaited his surrender while watching his imminent peril through a little hole meanwhile the cat came by and suddenly seized the weasel and forthwith devoured it then the rat offered up a sacrifice to jove of some of his store of nuts humbly thanking his providence and came out of his hole to enjoy his lately lost liberty but he was instantly deprived of it together with his life by the cruel claws and teeth of the lurking cat a fable the ant found a grain of millet the seed feeling itself taken prisoner cried out to her if you will do me the kindness to allow me accomplish my function of reproduction i will give you a hundred such as i am and so it was a spider found a bunch of grapes which for its sweetness was much resorted to by bees and divers kinds of flies it seemed to her that she had found a most convenient spot to spread her snare and having settled herself on it with her delicate web and entered into her new habitation there every day placing herself in the openings made by the spaces between the grapes she fell like a thief on the wretched creatures which were not aware of her but after a few days had passed the vintager came and cut away the bunch of grapes and put it with others with which it was trodden and thus the grapes were a snare and pitfall both for the treacherous spider and the betrayed flies an ass having gone to sleep on the ice over a deep lake his heat dissolved the ice and the ass awoke under water to his great grief and was forthwith drowned a falcon unable to endure with patience the disappearance of a duck which flying before him had plunged under water wished to follow it under water and having soaked his feathers had to remain in the water while the duck rising to the air mocked at the falcon as he drowned the spider wishing to take flies in her treacherous net was cruelly killed in it by the hornet an eagle wanting to mock at the owl was caught by the wings in bird lime and was taken and killed by a man fables on lifeless objects the water finding that its element was the lordly ocean was seized with a desire to rise above the air and being encouraged by the element of fire and rising as a very subtle vapour it seemed as though it were really as thin as air but having risen very high it reached the air that was still more rare and cold where the fire forsook it and the minute particles being brought together united and became heavy whence its haughtiness deserting it it betook itself to flight and it fell from the sky and was drunk up by the dry earth where being imprisoned for a long time it did penance for its sin a fable the razor having one day come forth from the handle which serves as its sheath and having placed himself in the sun saw the sun reflected in his body which filled him with great pride and turning it over in his thoughts he began to say to himself and shall i return again to that shop from which i have just come certainly not such splendid beauty shall not please god be turned to such base uses what folly it would be that could lead me to shave the lathered beards of rustic peasants and perform such menial service is this body destined for such work certainly not i will hide myself in some retired spot and there pass my life in tranquil repose and having thus remained hidden for some months one day he came out into the air and issuing from his sheath saw himself turned to the similitude of a rusty saw while his surface no longer reflected the resplendent sun with useless repentance he vainly deplored the irreparable mischief saying to himself oh how far better was it to employ at the barbers my lost edge of such exquisite keenness where is that lustrous surface it has been consumed by this vexatious and unsightly rust the same thing happens to those minds which instead of exercise give themselves up to sloth they are like the razor here spoken of and lose the keenness of their edge while the rust of ignorance spoils their form a fable a stone of some size recently uncovered by the water lay on a certain spot somewhat raised and just where a delightful grove ended by a stony road here it was surrounded by plants decorated by various flowers of divers colours and as it saw the great quantity of stones collected together in the roadway below it began to wish it could let itself fall down there saying to itself what have i to do here with these plants i want to live in the company of those my sisters and letting itself fall its rapid course ended among these longed for companions when it had been there sometime it began to find itself constantly toiling under the wheels of the carts the iron shoed feet of horses and of travellers this one rolled it over that one trod upon it sometimes it lifted itself a little and then it was covered with mud or the dung of some animal and it was in vain that it looked at the spot whence it had come as a place of solitude and tranquil place thus it happens to those who choose to leave a life of solitary comtemplation and come to live in cities among people full of infinite evil some flames had already lasted in the furnace of a glass blower when they saw a candle approaching in a beautiful and glittering candlestick with ardent longing they strove to reach it and one of them quitting its natural course writhed up to an unburnt brand on which it fed and passed at the opposite end out by a narrow chink to the candle which was near it flung itself upon it and with fierce jealousy and greediness it devoured it having reduced it almost to death and wishing to procure the prolongation of its life it tried to return to the furnace whence it had come but in vain for it was compelled to die the wood perishing together with the candle being at last converted with lamentation and repentance into foul smoke while leaving all its sisters in brilliant and enduring life and beauty a small patch of snow finding itself clinging to the top of a rock which was lying on the topmost height of a very high mountain and being left to its own imaginings it began to reflect in this way saying to itself now shall not i be thought vain and proud for having placed myself such a small patch of snow in so lofty a spot and for allowing that so large a quantity of snow as i have seen here around me should take a place lower than mine certainly my small dimensions by no means merit this elevation how easily may i in proof of my insignificance experience the same fate as that which the sun brought about yesterday to my companions who were all in a few hours destroyed by the sun and this happened from their having placed themselves higher than became them i will flee from the wrath of the sun and humble myself and find a place befitting my small importance thus flinging itself down it began to descend hurrying from its high home on to the other snow but the more it sought a low place the more its bulk increased so that when at last its course was ended on a hill it found itself no less in size than the hill which supported it and it was the last of the snow which was destroyed that summer by the sun this is said for those who humbling themselves become exalted fables on plants the cedar being desirous of producing a fine and noble fruit at its summit set to work to form it with all the strength of its sap but this fruit when grown was the cause of the tall and upright tree top being bent over the peach being envious of the vast quantity of fruit which she saw borne on the nut tree her neighbour determined to do the same and loaded herself with her own in such a way that the weight of the fruit pulled her up by the roots and broke her down to the ground the nut tree stood always by a road side displaying the wealth of its fruit to the passers by and every one cast stones at it the fig tree having no fruit no one looked at it then wishing to produce fruits that it might be praised by men it was bent and broken down by them the fig tree standing by the side of the elm and seeing that its boughs were bare of fruit yet that it had the audacity to keep the sun from its own unripe figs with its branches said to it oh elm art thou not ashamed to stand in front of me but wait till my offspring are fully grown and you will see where you are but when her offspring were mature a troop of soldiers coming by fell upon the fig tree and her figs were all torn off her and her boughs cut away and broken then when she was thus maimed in all her limbs the elm asked her saying o fig tree which was best to be without offspring or to be brought by them into so miserable a plight the plant complains of the old and dry stick which stands by its side and of the dry stakes that surround it one keeps it upright the other keeps it from low company a fable a nut having been carried by a crow to the top of a tall campanile and released by falling into a chink from the mortal grip of its beak it prayed the wall by the grace bestowed on it by god in allowing it to be so high and thick and to own such fine bells and of so noble a tone that it would succour it and that as it had not been able to fall under the verdurous boughs of its venerable father and lie in the fat earth covered up by his fallen leaves it would not abandon it because finding itself in the beak of the cruel crow it had there made a vow that if it escaped from her it would end its life in a little hole at these words the wall moved to compassion was content to shelter it in the spot where it had fallen and after a short time the nut began to split open and put forth roots between the rifts of the stones and push them apart and to throw out shoots from its hollow shell and to be brief these rose above the building and the twisted roots growing thicker began to thrust the walls apart and tear out the ancient stones from their old places then the wall too late and in vain bewailed the cause of its destruction and in a short time it wrought the ruin of a great part of it a fable the privet feeling its tender boughs loaded with young fruit pricked by the sharp claws and beak of the insolent blackbird complained to the blackbird with pitious remonstrance entreating her that since she stole its delicious fruits she should not deprive it of the leaves with which it preserved them from the burning rays of the sun and that she should not divest it of its tender bark by scratching it with her sharp claws to which the blackbird replied with angry upbraiding o be silent uncultured shrub do you not know that nature made you produce these fruits for my nourishment do you not see that you are in the world only to serve me as food do you not know base creature that next winter you will be food and prey for the fire to which words the tree listened patiently and not without tears after a short time the blackbird was taken in a net and boughs were cut to make a cage in which to imprison her branches were cut among others from the pliant privet to serve for the small rods of the cage and seeing herself to be the cause of the blackbird s loss of liberty it rejoiced and spoke as follows o blackbird i am here and not yet burnt by fire as you said i shall see you in prison before you see me burnt a fable the laurel and the myrtle seeing the pear tree cut down cried out with a loud voice o pear tree whither are you going where is the pride you had when you were covered with ripe fruits now you will no longer shade us with your mass of leaves then the pear tree replied i am going with the husbandman who has cut me down and who will take me to the workshop of a good sculptor who by his art will make me take the form of jove the god and i shall be dedicated in a temple and adored by men in the place of jove while you are bound always to remain maimed and stripped of your boughs which will be placed round me to do me honour a fable the chesnut seeing a man upon the fig tree bending its boughs down and pulling off the ripe fruits which he put into his open mouth destroying and crushing them with his hard teeth it tossed its long boughs and with a noisy rustle exclaimed o fig how much less are you protected by nature than i see how in me my sweet offspring are set in close array first clothed in soft wrappers over which is the hard but softly lined husk and not content with taking this care of me and having given them so strong a shelter on this she has placed sharp and close set spines so that the hand of man cannot hurt me then the fig tree and her offspring began to laugh and having laughed she said i know man to be of such ingenuity that with rods and stones and stakes flung up among your branches he will bereave you of your fruits and when they are fallen he will trample them with his feet or with stones so that your offspring will come out of their armour crushed and maimed while i am touched carefully by their hands and not like you with sticks and stones the hapless willow finding that she could not enjoy the pleasure of seeing her slender branches grow or attain to the height she wished or point to the sky by reason of the vine and whatever other trees that grew near but was always maimed and lopped and spoiled brought all her spirits together and gave and devoted itself entirely to imagination standing plunged in long meditation and seeking in all the world of plants with which of them she might ally herself and which could not need the help of her withes having stood for some time in this prolific imagination with a sudden flash the gourd presented itself to her thoughts and tossing all her branches with extreme delight it seemed to her that she had found the companion suited to her purpose because the gourd is more apt to bind others than to need binding having come to this conclusion she awaited eagerly some friendly bird who should be the mediator of her wishes presently seeing near her the magpie she said to him o gentle bird by the memory of the refuge which you found this morning among my branches when the hungry cruel and rapacious falcon wanted to devour you and by that repose which you have always found in me when your wings craved rest and by the pleasure you have enjoyed among my boughs when playing with your companions or making love i entreat you find the gourd and obtain from her some of her seeds and tell her that those that are born of them i will treat exactly as though they were my own flesh and blood and in this way use all the words you can think of which are of the same persuasive purport though indeed since you are a master of language i need not teach you and if you will do me this service i shall be happy to have your nest in the fork of my boughs and all your family without payment of any rent then the magpie having made and confirmed certain new stipulations with the willow and principally that she should never admit upon her any snake or polecat cocked his tail and put down his head and flung himself from the bough throwing his weight upon his wings and these beating the fleeting air now here now there bearing about inquisitively while his tail served as a rudder to steer him he came to a gourd then with a handsome bow and a few polite words he obtained the required seeds and carried them to the willow who received him with a cheerful face and when he had scraped away with his foot a small quantity of the earth near the willow describing a circle with his beak he planted the grains which in a short time began to grow and by their growth and the branches to take up all the boughs of the willow while their broad leaves deprived it of the beauty of the sun and sky and not content with so much evil the gourds next began by their rude hold to drag the ends of the tender shoots down towards the earth with strange twisting and distortion then being much annoyed it shook itself in vain to throw off the gourd after raving for some days in such plans vainly because the firm union forbade it seeing the wind come by it commended itself to him the wind flew hard and opened the old and hollow stem of the willow in two down to the roots so that it fell into two parts in vain did it bewail itself recognising that it was born to no good end iii jests and tales a jest a priest making the rounds of his parish on easter eve and sprinkling holy water in the houses as is customary came to a painter s room where he sprinkled the water on some of his pictures the painter turned round somewhat angered and asked him why this sprinkling had been bestowed on his pictures then said the priest that it was the custom and his duty to do so and that he was doing good and that he who did good might look for good in return and indeed for better since god had promised that every good deed that was done on earth should be rewarded a hundred fold from above then the painter waiting till he went out went to an upper window and flung a large pail of water on the priest s back saying here is the reward a hundred fold from above which you said would come from the good you had done me with your holy water by which you have damaged my pictures when wine is drunk by a drunkard that wine is revenged on the drinker wine the divine juice of the grape finding itself in a golden and richly wrought cup on the table of mahomet was puffed up with pride at so much honour when suddenly it was struck by a contrary reflection saying to itself what am i about that i should rejoice and not perceive that i am now near to my death and shall leave my golden abode in this cup to enter into the foul and fetid caverns of the human body and to be transmuted from a fragrant and delicious liquor into a foul and base one nay and as though so much evil as this were not enough i must for a long time lie in hideous receptacles together with other fetid and corrupt matter cast out from human intestines and it cried to heaven imploring vengeance for so much insult and that an end might henceforth be put to such contempt and that since that country produced the finest and best grapes in the whole world at least they should not be turned into wine then jove made that wine drunk by mahomet to rise in spirit to his brain and that in so deleterious a manner that it made him mad and gave birth to so many follies that when he had recovered himself he made a law that no asiatic should drink wine and henceforth the vine and its fruit were left free as soon as wine has entered the stomach it begins to ferment and swell then the spirit of that man begins to abandon his body rising as it were skywards and the brain finds itself parting from the body then it begins to degrade him and make him rave like a madman and then he does irreparable evil killing his friends an artizan often going to visit a great gentleman without any definite purpose the gentleman asked him what he did this for the other said that he came there to have a pleasure which his lordship could not have since to him it was a satisfaction to see men greater than himself as is the way with the populace while the gentleman could only see men of less consequence than himself and so lords and great men were deprived of that pleasure franciscan begging friars are wont at certain times to keep fasts when they do not eat meat in their convents but on journeys as they live on charity they have license to eat whatever is set before them now a couple of these friars on their travels stopped at an inn in company with a certain merchant and sat down with him at the same table where from the poverty of the inn nothing was served to them but a small roast chicken the merchant seeing this to be but little even for himself turned to the friars and said if my memory serves me you do not eat any kind of flesh in your convents at this season at these words the friars were compelled by their rule to admit without cavil that this was the truth so the merchant had his wish and eat the chicken and the friars did the best they could after dinner the messmates departed all three together and after travelling some distance they came to a river of some width and depth all three being on foot the friars by reason of their poverty and the other from avarice it was necessary by the custom of company that one of the friars being barefoot should carry the merchant on his shoulders so having given his wooden shoes into his keeping he took up his man but it so happened that when the friar had got to the middle of the river he again remembered a rule of his order and stopping short he looked up like saint christopher to the burden on his back and said tell me have you any money about you you know i have answered the other how do you suppose that a merchant like me should go about otherwise alack cried the friar our rules forbid as to carry any money on our persons and forthwith he dropped him into the water which the merchant perceived was a facetious way of being revenged on the indignity he had done them so with a smiling face and blushing somewhat with shame he peaceably endured the revenge a jest a man wishing to prove by the authority of pythagoras that he had formerly been in the world while another would not let him finish his argument the first speaker said to the second it is by this token that i was formerly here i remember that you were a miller the

painter why since he made such beautiful figures which were but dead things his children were so ugly to which the painter replied that he made his pictures by day and his children by night a man saw a large sword which another one wore at his side said he poor fellow for a long time i have seen you tied to that weapon why do you not release yourself as your hands are untied and set yourself free to which the other replied this is none of yours on the contrary it is an old story the former speaker feeling stung replied i know that you are acquainted with so few things in this world that i thought anything i could tell you would be new to you a man gave up his intimacy with one of his friends because he often spoke ill of his other friends the neglected friend one day lamenting to this former friend after much complaining entreated him to say what might be the cause that had made him forget so much friendship to which he answered i will no longer be intimate with you because i love you and i do not choose that you by speaking ill of me your friend to others should produce in others as in me a bad impression of yourself by speaking evil to them of me your friend therefore being no longer intimate together it will seem as though we had become enemies and in speaking evil of me as is your wont you will not be blamed so much as if we continued intimate a man was arguing and boasting that he knew many and various tricks another among the bystanders said i know how to play a trick which will make whomsoever i like pull off his breeches the first man the boaster said you won t make me pull off mine and i bet you a pair of hose on it he who proposed the game having accepted the offer produced breeches and drew them across the face of him who bet the pair of hose and won the bet a man said to an acquaintance your eyes are changed to a strange colour the other replied it often happens but you have not noticed it when does it happen said the former every time that my eyes see your ugly face from the shock of so unpleasing a sight they suddenly turn pale and change to a strange colour a man said to another your eyes are changed to a strange colour the other replied it is because my eyes behold your strange ugly face a man said that in his country were the strangest things in the world another answered you who were born there confirm this as true by the strangeness of your ugly face footnote the joke turns it appears on two meanings of trarre and is not easily translated an old man was publicly casting contempt on a young one and boldly showing that

yourself fall from great heights without any harm and torrents will accompany you and will mingle with their rapid course of christians many who hold the faith of the son only build temples in the name of the mother of food which has been alive a great portion of bodies that have been alive will pass into the bodies of other animals which is as much as to say that the deserted tenements will pass piecemeal into the inhabited ones furnishing them with good things and carrying with them their evils that is to say the life of man is formed from things eaten and these carry with them that part of man which dies of funeral rites and processions and lights and bells and followers the greatest honours will be paid to men and much pomp without their knowledge footnote a facsimile of this text is on pi cxvi below on the right but the writing is larger than the other notes on the same sheet and of a somewhat different style the ink is also of a different hue as may be seen on the original sheet at milan of the avaricious there will be many who will eagerly and with great care and solicitude follow up a thing which if they only knew its malignity would always terrify them of those men who the older they grow the more avaricious they become whereas having but little time to stay they should become more liberal we see those who are regarded as being most experienced and judicious when they least need a thing seek and cherish it with most avidity of the ditch many will be busied in taking away from a thing which will grow in proportion as it is diminished of a weight placed on a feather pillow and it will be seen in many bodies that by raising the head they swell visibly and by laying the raised head down again their size will immediately be diminished of catching lice and many will be hunters of animals which the fewer there are the more will be taken and conversely the more there are the fewer will be taken of drawing water in two buckets with a single rope and many will be busily occupied though the more of the thing they draw up the more will escape at the other end of the tongues of pigs and calves in sausage skins oh how foul a thing that we should see the tongue of one animal in the guts of another of sieves made of the hair of animals we shall see the food of animals pass through their skin everyway excepting through their mouths and penetrate from the outside downwards to the ground of lanterns footnote lanterns were in italy formerly made of horn the cruel horns of powerful bulls will screen the lights of night against the wild fury of the winds of feather beds flying creatures will give their very feathers to support men of animals which walk on trees wearing wooden shoes the mire will be so great that men will walk on the trees of their country of the soles of shoes which are made from the ox and in many parts of the country men will be seen walking on the skins of large beasts of sailing in ships there will be great winds by reason of which things of the east will become things of the west and those of the south being involved in the course of the winds will follow them to distant lands of worshipping the pictures of saints men will speak to men who hear not having their eyes open they will not see they will speak to these and they will not be answered they will implore favours of those who have ears and hear not they will make light for the blind of sawyers there will be many men who will move one against another holding in their hands a cutting tool but these will not do each other any injury beyond tiring each other for when one pushes forward the other will draw back but woe to him who comes between them for he will end by being cut in pieces of silk spinning dismal cries will be heard loud shrieking with anguish and the hoarse and smothered tones of those who will be despoiled and at last left naked and motionless and this by reason of the mover which makes every thing turn round of putting bread into the mouth of the oven and taking it out again in every city land castle and house men shall be seen who for want of food will take it out of the mouths of others who will not be able to resist in any way of tilled land the earth will be seen turned up side down and facing the opposite hemispheres uncovering the lurking holes of the fiercest animals of sowing seed then many of the men who will remain alive will throw the victuals they have preserved out of their houses a free prey to the birds and beasts of the earth without taking any care of them at all of the rains which by making the rivers muddy wash away the land footnote compare no something will fall from the sky which will transport a large part of africa which lies under that sky towards europe and that of europe towards

which teach precepts bodies without souls will by their contents give us precepts by which to die well of flagellants men will hide themselves under the bark of trees and screaming they will make themselves martyrs by striking their own limbs of the handles of knives made of the horns of sheep we shall see the horns of certain beasts fitted to iron tools which will take the lives of many of their kind of night when no colour can be discerned there will come a time when no difference can be discerned between colours on the contrary everything will be black alike of swords and spears which by themselves never hurt any one one who by himself is mild enough and void of all offence will become terrible and fierce by being in bad company and will most cruelly take the life of many men and would kill many more if they were not hindered by bodies having no soul that have come out of caverns that is breastplates of iron of snares and traps many dead things will move furiously and will take and bind the living and will ensnare them for the enemies who seek their death and destruction of metals that shall be brought forth out of dark and obscure caves which will put the whole human race in great anxiety peril and death to many that seek them after many sorrows they will give delight and to those who are not in their company death with want and misfortune this will lead to the commission of endless crimes this will increase and persuade bad men to assassinations robberies and treachery and by reason of it each will be suspicious of his partner this will deprive free cities of their happy condition this will take away the lives of many this will make men torment each other with many artifices deceptions and treasons o monstrous creature how much better would it be for

devoid of life carrying in fierce haste a multitude of men to the destruction of their lives of oxen which are eaten the masters of estates will eat their own labourers of beating beds to renew them men will be seen so deeply ungrateful that they will turn upon that which has harboured them for nothing at all they will so load it with blows that a great part of its inside will come out of its place and will be turned over and over in its body of things which are eaten and which first are killed those who nourish them will be killed by them and afflicted by merciless deaths of the reflection of walls of cities in the water of their ditches the high walls of great cities will be seen up side down in their ditches of water which flows turbid and mixed with soil and dust and of mist which is mixed with the air and of fire which is mixed with its own and each with each all the elements will be seen mixed together in a great whirling mass now borne towards the centre of the world now towards the sky and now furiously rushing from the south towards the frozen north and sometimes from the east towards the west and then again from this hemisphere to the other the world may be divided into two hemispheres at any point all men will suddenly be transferred into opposite hemispheres the division of the east from the west may be made at any point all living creatures will be moved from the east to the west and in the same way from north to south and vice versa of the motion of water which carries wood which is dead bodies devoid of life will move by themselves and carry with them endless generations of the dead taking the wealth from the bystanders of eggs which being eaten cannot form chickens oh how many will they be that never come to the birth of fishes which are eaten unborn endless generations will be lost by the death of the pregnant of the lamentation on good friday throughout europe there will be a lamentation of great nations over the death of one man who died in the east of dreaming men will walk and not stir they will talk to those who are not present and hear those who do not speak of a man s shadow which moves with him shapes and figures of men and animals will be seen following these animals and men wherever they flee and exactly as the one moves the other moves but what seems so wonderful is the variety of height they assume of our shadow cast by the sun and our reflection in the water at one and the same time many a time will one man be seen as three and all three move together and often the most real one quits him of wooden chests which contain great treasures within walnuts and trees and other plants vast treasures will be found which lie hidden there and well guarded of putting out the light when going to bed many persons puffing out a breath with too much haste will thereby lose their sight and soon after all consciousness of the bells of mules which are close to their ears in many parts of europe instruments of various sizes will be heard making divers harmonies with great labour to those who hear them most closely of asses the severest labour will be repaid with hunger and thirst and discomfort and blows and goadings and curses and great abuse of soldiers on horseback many men will be seen carried by large animals swift of pace to the loss of their lives and immediate death in the air and on earth animals will be seen of divers colours furiously carrying men to the destruction of their lives of the stars of spurs by the aid of the stars men will be seen who will be as swift as any swift animal of a stick which is dead the motions of a dead thing will make many living ones flee with pain and lamentation and cries of tinder with a stone and with iron things will be made visible which before were not seen of going in ships we shall see the trees of the great forests of taurus and of sinai and of the appenines and others rush by means of the air from east to west and from north to south and carry by means of the air great multitudes of men oh how many vows oh how many deaths oh how many partings of friends and relations oh how many will those be who will never again see their own country nor their native land and who will die unburied with their bones strewn in various parts of the world of moving on all saints day many will forsake their own dwellings and carry with them all their belongings and will go to live in other parts of all souls day how many will they be who will bewail their deceased forefathers carrying lights to them of friars who spending nothing but words receive great gifts and bestow paradise invisible money will procure the triumph of many who will spend it of bows made of the horns of oxen many will there be who will die a painful death by means of the horns of cattle of writing letters from one country to another men will speak with each other from the most remote countries and reply of hemispheres which are infinite and which are divided by an infinite number of lines so that every man always has one of these lines between his feet men standing in opposite hemispheres will converse and deride each other and embrace each other and understand

will give up work and labour and poverty of life and goods and will go to live among wealth in splendid buildings declaring that this is the way to make themselves acceptable to god of selling paradise an infinite number of men will sell publicly and unhindered things of the very highest price without leave from the master of it while it never was theirs nor in their power and human justice will not prevent it of the dead which are carried to be buried the simple folks will carry vast quantities of lights to light up the road for those who have entirely lost the power of sight of dowries for maidens and whereas at first maidens could not be protected against the violence of men neither by the watchfulness of parents nor by strong walls the time will come when the fathers and parents of those girls will pay a large price to a man who wants to marry them even if they are rich noble and most handsome certainly this seems as though nature wished to eradicate the human race as being useless to the world and as spoiling all created things of the cruelty of man animals will be seen on the earth who will always be fighting against each other with the greatest loss and frequent deaths on each side and there will be no end to their malignity by their strong limbs we shall see a great portion of the trees of the vast forests laid low throughout the universe and when they are filled with food the satisfaction of their desires will be to deal death and grief and labour and wars and fury to every living thing and from their immoderate pride they will desire to rise towards heaven but the too great weight of their limbs will keep them down nothing will remain on earth or under the earth or in the waters which will not be persecuted disturbed and spoiled and those of one country removed into another and their bodies will become the sepulture and means of transit of all they have killed o earth why dost thou not open and engulf them in the fissures of thy vast abyss

the south to the north in confusion round and about the universe with great noise and trembling or fury in the east wind which rushes to the west the solar rays will kindle fire on the earth by which a thing that is under the sky will be set on fire and being reflected by some obstacle it will bend downwards the concave mirror kindles a fire with which we heat the oven and this has its foundation

its place this is by rivers which carry the earth they wash away from the mountains and bear it to the sea shore and where the earth comes the sea must retire the water dropped from the clouds still in motion on the flanks of mountains will lie still for a long period of time without any motion whatever and this will happen in many and divers lands snow which falls in flakes and is water the

this animal has a horror of the poor because they eat poor food and it loves the rich because they have good living and especially meat and the excrement of animals always retains some virtue of its

smell in them the virtue of meat or of other things they take them and if not they leave them and to return to the question i say that if by means of this smell they know that dog to be well fed they respect him because they judge that he has a powerful and rich master and if they discover no such smell with the virtue of meet they judge that dog to be of small account and to have a poor and humble master and therefore they bite that dog as they would his master the circular plans of carrying earth are very useful inasmuch as men never stop in their work and it is done in many ways by one

the measure you did not know before master giovanni da lodi xxi letters personal records dated notes when we consider how superficial and imperfect are the accounts of leonardo s life written some time after his death by vasari and others any notes or letters which can throw more light on his personal circumstances cannot fail to be in the highest degree interesting the texts here given as nos set his residence in rome in quite a new aspect nay the picture which irresistibly dwells in our minds after reading these details of his life in the vatican forms a striking contrast to the contemporary life of raphael at rome i have placed foremost of these documents the very remarkable letters to the defterdar of syria in these leonardo speaks of himself as having staid among the mountains of armenia and as the biographies of the master tell nothing of any such distant journeys it would seem most obvious to treat this passage as fiction and so spare ourselves the onus of proof and discussion but on close examination no one can doubt that these documents with the accompanying sketches are the work of leonardo s own hand not merely is the character of the handwriting his but the spelling and the language are his also in one respect only does the writing betray any marked deviation from the rest of the notes especially those treating on scientific questions namely in these observations he seems to have taken particular pains to give the most distinct and best form of expression to all he had to say we find erasures and emendations in almost every line he proceeded as we shall see in the same way in the sketches for letters to giuliano de medici and what can be more natural i may ask than to find the draft of a letter thus altered and improved when it is to contain an account of a definite subject and when personal interests are in the scale the finished copies as sent off are not known to exist if we had these instead of the rough drafts we might unhesitatingly have declared that some unknown italian engineer must have been at that time engaged in armenia in the service of the egyptian sultan and that leonardo had copied his documents under this hypothesis however we should have to state that this unknown writer must have been so far one in mind with leonardo as to use the same style of language and even the same lines of thought this explanation might as i say have been possible if only we had the finished letters but why should these rough drafts of letters be regarded as anything else than what they actually and obviously are if leonardo had been a man of our own time we might perhaps have attempted to account for the facts by saying that leonardo without having been in the east himself might have undertaken to write a romance of which the scene was laid in armenia and at the desire of his publisher had made sketches of landscape to illustrate the text i feel bound to mention this singular hypothesis as it has actually been put forward see no note and it would certainly seem as though there were no other possible way of evading the conclusion to which these letters point and their bearing on the life of the master absurd as the alternative is but if on a question of such importance we are justified in suggesting theories that have no foundation in probability i could suggest another which as compared with that of a fiction by leonardo would be neither more nor less plausible it is moreover the only other hypothesis perhaps which can be devised to account for these passages if it were possible to prove that the interpretation that the documents themselves suggest must be rejected a priori viz may not leonardo have written them with the intention of mystifying those who after his death should try to decipher these manuscripts with a view to publishing them but if in fact no objection that will stand the test of criticism can be brought against the simple and direct interpretation of the words as they stand we are bound to regard leonardo s travels in the east as an established fact there is i believe nothing in what we know of his biography to negative such a fact especially as the details of his life for some few years are wholly unknown nor need we be at a loss for evidence which may serve to explain at any rate to some extent the strangeness of his undertaking such a journey we have no information as to leonardo s history between and it cannot be proved that he was either in milan or in florence on the other hand the tenor of this letter does not require us to assume a longer absence than a year or two for even if his appointment offitio as engineer in syria had been a permanent one it might have become untenable by the death perhaps of the defterdar his patron or by his removal from office and leonardo on his return home may have kept silence on the subject of an episode which probably had ended in failure and disappointment from the text of no we can hardly doubt that leonardo intended to make an excursion secretly from rome to naples although so far as has hitherto been known his biographers never allude to it in another place no he says that he had worked as an engineer in friuli are we to doubt this statement too merely because no biographer has hitherto given us any information on the matter in the geographical notes leonardo frequently speaks of the east and though such passages afford no direct proof of his having been there they show beyond a doubt that next to the nile the euphrates the tigris and the taurus mountains had a special interest in his eyes as a still further proof of the futility of the argument that there is nothing in his drawings to show that he had travelled in the east we find on pl cxx a study of oriental heads of armenian type though of course this may have been made in italy if the style of these letters were less sober and the expressions less strictly to the point throughout it miglit be possible to regard them as a romantic fiction instead of a narrative of fact nay we have only to compare them with such obviously fanciful passages as no nos and the fables and prophecies it is unnecessary to discuss the subject any further here such explanations as the letter needs are given in the foot notes the drafts of letters to lodovico il moro are very remarkable leonardo and this prince were certainly far less closely connected than has hitherto been supposed it is impossible that leonardo can have remained so long in the service of this prince because the salary was good as is commonly stated on the contrary it would seem that what kept him there in spite of his sore need of the money owed him by the prince was the hope of some day being able to carry out the project of casting the gran cavallo

alone but the whole world which footnote lines are reproduced in facsimile on pl cxvi diodario this word is not to be found in any italian dictionary and for a long time i vainly sought an explanation of it the youthful reminiscences of my wife afforded the desired clue the chief town of each turkish villayet or province such as broussa for instance in asia minor is the residence of a defterdar who presides over the financial affairs of the province defterdar hane was in former times the name given to the ministry of finance at constantinople the minister of finance to the porte is now known as the mallie nazri and the defterdars are his subordinates a defterdar at the present day is merely the head of the finance department in each provincial district with regard to my suggestion that leonardo s diodario might be identical with the defterdar of former times the late m c defremerie arabic professor and membre de l institut de france wrote to me as follows votre conjecture est parfaitement fondee diodario est vequivalent de devadar ou plus exactement devatdar titre d une importante dignite en egypt e sous les mamlouks the word however is not of turkish but of perso arabie derivation defter written in arab literally defter arabic meaning folio for dar persian bookkeeper or holder is the english equivalent and the idea is that of a deputy in command during the mamelook supremacy over syria which corresponded in date with leonardo s time the office of defterdar was the third in importance in the state soltano di babilonia the name of babylon was commonly applied to cairo in the middle ages for instance breidenbach itinerarium hierosolyma p says at last we reached babylon but this is not that babylon which stood on the further shore of the river chober but that which is called the egyptian babylon it is close by cairo and the twain are but one and not two towns one half is called cairo and the other babylon whence they are called together cairo babylon originally the town is said to have been named memphis and then babylon but now it is called cairo compare no egypt was governed from till by the borgite or tcherkessian dynasty of the mamelook sultans one of the most famous of these sultan kait bey ruled from during whose reign the gama or mosque of kait bey and tomb of kait bey near the okella kait bey were erected in cairo which preserve his name to this day under the rule of this great and wise prince many foreigners particularly italians found occupation in egypt as may be seen in the viaggio di josaphat barbaro among other travellers next to leonardo so i learn from prof jac burckhardt of bale kait bey s most helpful engineer was a german who in about superintended the construction of the mole at alexandria felix fabri knew him and mentions him in his historia suevorum written in il nuovo accidente accaduto or as leonardo first wrote and then erased e accaduto un nuovo accidente from the sequel this must refer to an earthquake and indeed these were frequent at that period particularly in asia minor where they caused immense mischief see no note shall be related to you in due order showing first the effect and then the cause footnote the text here breaks off the following lines are a fresh beginning of a letter evidently addressed to the same person but as it would seem written at a later date than the previous text the numerous corrections and amendments amply prove that it is not a copy from any account of a journey by some unknown person but on the contrary that leonardo was particularly anxious to choose such words and phrases as might best express his own ideas finding myself in this part of armenia footnote parti d erminia see no note the extent of armenia in leonardo s time is only approximately known in the xvth century the persians governed the eastern and the arabs the southern portions arabic authors as for instance abulfeda include cilicia and a part of cappadocia in armenia and greater armenia was the tract of that country known later as turcomania while armenia minor was the territory between cappadocia and the euphrates it was not till or even that the whole country came under the dominion of the ottoman turks in the reign of selim i the mamelook sultans of egypt seem to have taken a particular interest in this the most northern province of their empire which was even then in danger of being conquered by the turks in the autumn of sultan kait bey made a journey of inspection visiting antioch and the valleys of the tigris and euphrates with a numerous and brilliant escort this tour is briefly alluded to by moodshireddin p and by weil geschichte der abbasiden v p an anonymous member of the suite wrote a diary of the expedition in arabic which has been published by r v lonzone viaggio in palestina e soria di kaid ba xviii sultano della ii dinastia mamelucca fatto nel testo arabo torino without notes or commentary compare the critique on this edition by j gildemeister in zeitschrift des deutschen palaestina vereins vol ill p lanzone s edition seems to be no more than an abridged copy of the original i owe to professor sche fer membre de l institut the information that he is in possession of a manuscript in which the text is fuller and more correctly given the mamelook dynasty was as is well known of circassian origin and a large proportion of the egyptian army was recruited in circassia even so late as in the xvth century that was a period of political storms in syria and asia minor and it is easy to suppose that the sultan s minister to whom leonardo addresses his report as his superior had a special interest in the welfare of those frontier provinces only to mention a few historical events of sultan kait bey s reign we find that in he assisted the circassians to resist the encroachments of alaeddoulet an asiatic prince who had allied himself with the osmanli to threaten the province the consequence was a war in cilicia by sea and land which broke out in the following year between the contending powers only a few years earlier the same province had been the scene of the so called caramenian war in which the united venetian neapolitan and sclavonic fleets had been engaged see corialano cippico della guerra dei veneziani nell asia dal venezia p and we learn incidentally that a certain leonardo boldo governor of scutari under sultan mahmoud as his name would indicate one of the numerous renegades of italian birth played an important part in the negotiations for peace tu mi mandasti the address tu to a personage so high in office is singular and suggests personal intimacy leonardo seems to have been a favourite with the diodario compare lines and i have endeavoured to show and i believe that i am also in a position to prove with regard to these texts that they are draughts of letters actually written by leonardo at the same time i must not omit to mention that shortly after i had discovered these texts in the codex atlanticus and published a paper on the subject in the zeitschrift fur bildende kunst vol xvi prof govi put forward this hypothesis to account for their origin quanto alle notizie sul monte tauro sull armenia e sull asia minore che si contengono negli altri frammenti esse vennero prese da qualche geografro o viaggiatore contemporaneo dall indice imperfetto che accompagna quei frammenti si potrebbe dedurre che leonardo volesse farne un libro che poi non venne compiuto a ogni modo non e possibile di trovare in questi brani nessun indizio di un viaggio di leonardo in oriente ne della sua conversione alla religione di maometto come qualcuno pretenderebbe leonardo amava con passione gli studi geografici e nel suoi scritti s incontran spesso itinerart indicazioni o descrizioni di luoghi schizzi di carte e abbozzi topografici di varie regioni non e quindi strano che egli abile narratore com era si fosse proposto di scrivere una specie di romanzo in forma epistolare svolgendone pintreccio nell asia minore intorno alla quale i libri d allora e forse qualche viaggiatore amico suo gli avevano somministrato alcuni elementi piu o meno fantastici see transunti della reale accademia dei lincei voi v ser it is hardly necessary to point out that prof govi omits to name the sources from which leonardo could be supposed to have drawn his information and i may leave it to the reader to pronounce judgment on the anomaly which is involved in the hypothesis that we have here a fragment of a romance cast in the form of a correspondence at the same time i cannot but admit that the solution of the difficulties proposed by prof govi is under the circumstances certainly the easiest way of dealing with the question but we should then be equally justified in supposing some more of leonardo s letters to be fragments of such romances particularly those of which the addresses can no longer be named still as regards these drafts of letters to the diodario if we accept the romance theory as pro posed by prof govi we are also compelled to assume that leonardo purposed from the first to illustrate his tale for it needs only a glance at the sketches on pi cxvi to cxix to perceive that they are connected with the texts and of course the rest of leonardo s numerous notes on matters pertaining to the east the greater part of which are here published for the first time may also be somehow connected with this strange romance citta de calindra chalindra the position of this city is so exactly determined between the valley of the euphrates and the taurus range that it ought to be possible to identify it but it can hardly be the same as the sea port of cilicia with a somewhat similar name celenderis kelandria celendria kilindria now the turkish gulnar in two catalonian portulans in the bibliotheque natio nale in paris one dating from the xv h century by wilhelm von soler the other by olivez de majorca in l i find this place called calandra but leonardo s calindra must certainly have lain more to the north west probably somewhere in kurdistan the fact that the geographical position is so care fully determined by leonardo seems to prove that it was a place of no great importance and little known it is singular that the words first written in were divisa dal lago lake van altered afterwards to dall eitfrates nostri confini and in proposito nostro these refer to the frontier and to the affairs of the mamelook sultan lines and throw some light on the purpose of leonardo s mission i corni del gra mote tauro compare the sketches pi cxvi cxviii so long as it is im possible to identify the situation of calindra it is most difficult to decide with any certainty which peak of the taurus is here meant and i greatly regret that i had no foreknowledge of this puzzling topographical question when in i was pursuing archaeological enquiries in the provinces of aleppo and cilicia and had to travel for some time in view of the imposing snow peaks of bulghar dagh and ala tepessi the opinion here expressed as to the height of the mountain would be unmeaning unless it had been written before leonardo moved to milan where monte rosa is so conspicuous an object in the landscape ore inanzi seems to mean four hours before the sun s rays penetrate to the bottom of the valleys to carry into effect with due love and care the task for which you sent me footnote and to make a beginning in a place which seemed to me to be most to our purpose i entered into the city of calindrafy near to our frontiers this city is situated at the base of that part of the taurus mountains which is divided from the euphrates and looks towards the peaks of the great mount taurus to the west these peaks are of such a height that they seem to touch the sky and in all the world there is no part of the earth higher than its summit and the rays of the sun always fall upon it on its east side four hours before day time and being of the whitest stone footnote pietra bianchissima the taurus mountains consist in great part of limestone it shines resplendently and fulfils the function to these armenians which a bright moon light would in the midst of the darkness and by its great height it outreaches the utmost level of the clouds by a space of four miles in a straight line this peak is seen in many places towards the west illuminated by the sun after its setting the third part of the night this it is which with you footnote appresso di voi leonardo had at first written noi as though his meaning had been this peak appeared to us to be a comet when you and i observed it in north syria at aleppo at aintas the description of the curious reflection in the evening resembling the alpine glow is certainly not an invented fiction for in the next lines an explanation of the phenomenon is offered or at least attempted we formerly in calm weather had supposed to be a comet and appears to us in the darkness of night to change its form being sometimes divided in two or three parts and sometimes long and sometimes short and this is caused by the clouds on the horizon of the sky which interpose between part of this mountain and the sun and by cutting off some of the solar rays the light on the mountain is intercepted by various intervals of clouds and therefore varies in the form of its brightness the divisions of the book footnote the next lines are evidently the contents of a connected report or book but not of one which he had at hand more probably indeed of one he purposed writing the praise and confession of the faith footnote persuasione di fede of the christian or the mohammedan faith we must suppose the latter at the beginning of a document addressed to so high a mohammedan official predica probably stands as an abbreviation for predicazione lat praedicatio in the sense of praise or glorification very probably it may mean some such initial doxology as we find in mohammedan works comp the sudden inundation to its end the destruction of the city the death of the people and their despair the preacher s search his release and benevolence footnote the phraseology of this is too general for any conjecture as to its meaning to be worth hazarding description of the cause of this fall of the mountain footnote ruina del monte of course by an earthquake in a catalogue of earthquakes entitled kechf aussalssaleb an auasf ezzel zeleh and written by djelal eddin the mischief it did fall of snow the finding of the prophet his prophesy the inundation of the lower portion of eastern armenia the draining of which was effected by the cutting through the taurus mountains how the new prophet showed footnote nova profeta profeta mohammed leonardo here refers to the koran in the name of the most merciful god when the earth shall be shaken by an earthquake and the earth shall cast forth her burdens and a man shall say what aileth her on that day the earth shall declare her tidings for that thy lord will inspire her on that day men shall go forward in distinct classes that they may behold their works and whoever shall have wrought good of the weight of an ant shall behold the same and whoever shall have wrought evil of the weight of an ant shall behold the same the koran translated by g sale chapter xcix p that this destruction would happen as he had foretold description of the taurus mountains and the river euphrates why the mountain shines at the top from half to a third of the night and looks like a comet to the inhabitants of the west after the sunset and before day to those of the east why this comet appears of variable forms so that it is now round and now long and now again divided into two or three parts and now in one piece and when it is to be seen again of the shape of the taurus mountains footnote the facsimile of this passage is given on pl cxvii i am not to be accused oh devatdar of idleness as your chidings seem to hint but your excessive love for me which gave rise to the benefits you have conferred on me footnote is that which has also compelled me to the utmost painstaking in seeking out and diligently investigating the cause of so great and stupendous an effect and this could not be done without time now in order to satisfy you fully as to the cause of so great an effect it is requisite that i should explain to you the form of the place and then i will proceed to the effect by which i believe you will be amply satisfied footnote tagliata di monte tauro the euphrates flows through the taurus range near the influx of the kura shai it rushes through a rift in the wildest cliffs from to feet high and runs on for miles in falls or rapids till it reaches telek near which at a spot called gleikash or the hart s leap it measures only paces across compare the map on pl cxix and the explanation for it on p footnote the foregoing sketch of a letter lines appears to have remained a fragment when leonardo received pressing orders which caused him to write immediately and fully on the subject mentioned in line footnote this passage was evidently intended as an improvement on that immediately preceding it the purport of both is essentially the same but the first is pitched in a key of ill disguised annoyance which is absent from the second i do not see how these two versions can be reconciled with the romance theory held by prof govi do not be aggrieved o devatdar by my delay in responding to your pressing request for those things which you require of me are of such a nature that they cannot be well expressed without some lapse of time particularly because in order to explain the cause of so great an effect it is necessary to describe with accuracy the nature of the place and by this means i can afterwards easily satisfy your above mentioned request footnote this passage was evidently intended as an improvement on that immediately preceding it the purport of both is essentially the same but the first is pitched in a key of ill disguised annoyance which is absent from the second i do not see how these two versions can be reconciled with the romance theory held by prof govi i will pass over any description of the form of asia minor or as to what seas or lands form the limits of its outline and extent because i know that by your own diligence and carefulness in your studies you have not remained in ignorance of these matters and i will go on to describe the true form of the taurus mountain which is the cause of this stupendous and harmful marvel and which will serve to advance us in our purpose this taurus is that mountain which with many others is said to be the ridge of mount caucasus but wishing to be very clear about it i desired to speak to some of the inhabitants of the shores of the caspian sea who give evidence that this must be the true caucasus and that though their mountains bear the same name yet these are higher and to confirm this in the scythian tongue caucasus means a very high footnote caucasus herodot kaoxaais armen kaukaz peak and in fact we have no information of there being in the east or in the west any mountain so high and the proof of this is that the inhabitants of the countries to the west see the rays of the sun illuminating a great part of its summit for as much as a quarter of the longest night and in the same way in those countries which lie to the east of the structure and size of mount taurus footnote the statements are of course founded on those of the inhabitants spoken of in the shadow of this ridge of the taurus is of such a height that when in the middle of june the sun is at its meridian its shadow extends as far as the borders of sarmatia twelve days off and in the middle of december it extends as far as the hyperborean mountains which are at a month s journey to the north and the side which faces the wind is always free from clouds and mists because the wind which is parted in beating on the rock closes again on the further side of that rock and in its motion carries with it the clouds from all quarters and leaves them where it strikes and it is always full of thunderbolts from the great quantity of clouds which accumulate there whence the rock is all riven and full of huge debris footnote sudden storms are equally common on the heights of ararat it is hardly necessary to observe that ararat cannot be meant here its summit is formed like the crater of vesuvius the peaks sketched on pl cxvi cxviii are probably views of the same mountain taken from different sides near the solitary peak pl cxviii these three names are written goba arnigasar caruda names most likely of different peaks pl cxvi and cxvii are in the original on a single sheet folded down the middle centimetres high

mountains perhaps to indicate the inundation mentioned in l the affluent to the euphrates shown as coming with many windings from the high land of argeo on the west is the tochma su which joins the main river at malatie i have not been able to discover any map of armenia of the xvth or xvith century in which the course of the euphrates is laid down with any thing like the correctness displayed in this sketch the best i have seen is the catalonian portulan of olivez de majorca executed in and it is far behind leonardo s this mountain at its base is inhabited by a very rich population and is full of most beautiful springs and rivers and is fertile and abounding in all good produce particularly in those parts which face to the south but after mounting about three miles we begin to find forests of great fir trees and beech and other similar trees after this for a space of three more miles there are meadows and vast pastures and all the rest as far as the beginning of the taurus is eternal snows which never disappear at any time and extend to a height of about fourteen miles in all from this beginning of the taurus up to the height of a mile the clouds never pass away thus we have fifteen miles that is a height of about five miles in a straight line and the summit of the peaks of the taurus are as much or about that there half way up we begin to find a scorching air and never feel a breath of wind but nothing can live long there there nothing is brought forth save a few birds of prey which breed in the high fissures of taurus and descend below the clouds to seek their prey above the wooded hills all is bare rock that is from the clouds upwards and the rock is the purest white and it is impossible to walk to the high summit on account of the rough and perilous ascent footnote on comparing this commencement of a letter l with that in l and of no it is quite evident that both refer to the same event compare also no l l and with no l and but the text no including the fragment l was obviously written later than the draft here reproduced the diodario is not directly addressed the person addressed indeed is not known and it seems to me highly probable that it was written to some other patron and friend whose name and position are not mentioned having often made you by my letters acquainted with the things which have happened i think i ought not to be silent as to the events of the last few days which having several times having many times rejoiced with you by letters over your prosperous fortunes i know now that as a friend you will be sad with me over the miserable state in which i find myself and this is that during the last few days i have been in so much trouble fear peril and loss besides the miseries of the people here that we have been envious of the dead and certainly i do not believe that since the elements by their separation reduced the vast chaos to order they have ever combined their force and fury to do so much mischief to man as far as regards us here what we have seen and gone through is such that i could not imagine that things could ever rise to such an amount of mischief as we experienced in the space of ten hours in the first place we were assailed and attacked by the violence and fury of the winds to this was added the falling of great mountains of snow which filled up all this valley thus destroying a great part of our city footnote della nostra citta leonardo first wrote di questa citta from this we may infer that he had at some time lived in the place in question wherever it might be and not content with this the tempest sent a sudden flood of water to submerge all the low part of this city added to which there came a sudden rain or rather a ruinous torrent and flood of water sand mud and stones entangled with roots and stems and fragments of various trees and every kind of thing flying through the air fell upon us finally a great fire broke out not brought by the wind but carried as it would seem by ten thousand devils which completely burnt up all this neighbourhood and it has not yet ceased and those few who remain unhurt are in such dejection and such terror that they hardly have courage to speak to each other as if they were stunned having abandoned all our business we stay here together in the ruins of some churches men and women mingled together small and great footnote certe ruine di chiese either of armenian churches or of mosques which it was not unusual to speak of as churches maschi e femmini insieme unite implies an infringement of the usually strict rule of the separation of the sexes just like herds of goats the neighbours out of pity succoured us with victuals and they had previously been our enemies and if footnote i vicini nostri nimici the town must then have stood quite close to the frontier of the country compare l vicini ai nostri confini dr m jordan has already published lines see das malerbuch leipzig p his reading differs from mine under the title of description of a landscape near lake como we do in fact find among other loose sheets in the codex atlanticus certain texts referring to valleys of the alps see nos and note p and in the arrangement of the loose sheets of which the codex atlanticus has been formed these happen to be placed close to this text the compiler stuck both on the same folio sheet and if this is not the reason for dr jordan s choosing such a title description c i cannot imagine what it can have been it is at any rate a merely hypothetical statement the designation of the population of the country round a city as the enemy nemici is hardly appropriate to italy in the time of leonardo it had not been for certain people who succoured us with victuals all would have died of hunger now you see the state we are in and all these evils are as nothing compared with those which are promised to us shortly i know that as a friend you will grieve for my misfortunes as i in former letters have shown my joy at your prosperity notes about events observed abroad book of the movement of air enclosed in water i have seen motions of the air so furious that they have carried mixed up in their course the largest trees of the forest and whole roofs of great palaces and i have seen the same fury bore a hole with a whirling movement digging out a gravel pit and carrying gravel sand and water more than half a mile through the air footnote the first sixteen lines of this passage which treat of the subject as indicated on the title line have no place in this connexion and have been omitted footnote ho veduto movimenti c nothing of the kind happened in italy during leonardo s lifetime and it is therefore extremely probable that this refers to the natural phenomena which are so fully described in the foregoing passage compare too no there can be no doubt that the descriptions of the deluge in the libro di pittura vol i no and that of the fall of a mountain no l were written from the vivid impressions derived from personal experience compare also pl xxxiv xl footnote it may be inferred from the character of the writing which is in the style of the note in facsimile vol i p that this passage was written between and as the figure at the end of the text indicates it was continued on another page but i have searched in vain for it the reverse of this leaf is coloured red for drawing in silver point but has not been used for that purpose but for writing on and at about the same date the passages are given as nos and no see note page the text given above is obviously not a fragment of a letter but a record of some personal experience no also seems to refer to leonardo s journeys in southern italy like a whirling wind which rushes down a sandy and hollow valley and which in its hasty course drives to its centre every thing that opposes its furious course no otherwise does the northern blast whirl round in its tempestuous progress nor does the tempestuous sea bellow so loud when the northern blast dashes it with its foaming waves between scylla and charybdis nor stromboli nor mount etna when their sulphurous flames having been forcibly confined rend and burst open the mountain fulminating stones and earth through the air together with the flames they vomit nor when the inflamed caverns of mount etna footnote mongibello is a name commonly given in sicily to mount etna from djebel arab mountain fr ferrara descrizione dell etna con la storia delle eruzioni palermo p tells us on the authority of the cronaca del monastero benedettino di licordia of an eruption of the volcano with a great flow of lava on sept the next records of the mountain are from the years and a percy neither does mention any eruptions of etna during the years to which this note must probably refer memoire des tremblements de terre de la peninsule italique vol xxii des memoires couronnees et memoires des savants etrangers academie royal de belgique a literal interpretation of the passage would not however indicate an allusion to any great eruption particularly in the connection with stromboli where the periodical outbreaks in very short intervals are very striking to any observer especially at night time when passing the island on the way from naples to messina rejecting the ill restained element vomit it forth back to its own region driving furiously before it every obstacle that comes in the way of its impetuous rage unable to resist my eager desire and wanting to see the great of the various and strange shapes made by formative nature and having wandered some distance among gloomy rocks i came to the entrance of a great cavern in front of which i stood some time astonished and unaware of such a thing bending my back into an arch i rested my left hand on my knee and held my right hand over my down cast and contracted eye brows often bending first one way and then the other to see whether i could discover anything inside and this being forbidden by the deep darkness within and after having remained there some time two contrary emotions arose in me fear and desire fear of the threatening dark cavern desire to see whether there were any marvellous thing within it drafts of letters to lodovico il moro footnote the numerous corrections the alterations in the figures l and the absence of any signature prove that this is merely the rough draft of a letter to lodovico il moro it is one of the very few manuscripts which are written from left to right see the facsimile of the beginning as here reproduced this is probably the final sketch of a document the clean of which copy was written in the usual manner leonardo no doubt very rarely wrote so and this is probably the reason of the conspicuous dissimilarity in the handwriting when he did compare pl xxxviii it is noteworthy too that here the orthography and abbreviations are also exceptional but such superficial peculiarities are not enough to stamp the document as altogether spurious it is neither a forgery nor the production of any artist but leonardo himself as to this point the contents leave us no doubt as to its authenticity particularly l see no where this passage is repeated but whether the fragment as we here see it was written from leonardo s dictation a theory favoured by the orthography the erasures and corrections or whether it may be a copy made for or by melzi or mazenta is comparatively unimportant there are in the codex atlanticus a few other documents not written by leonardo himself but the notes in his own hand found on the reverse pages of these leaves amply prove that they were certainly in leonardo s possession this mark of ownership is wanting to the text in question but the compilers of the codex atlanticus at any rate accepted it as a genuine document with regard to the probable date of this projected letter see vol ii p most illustrious lord having now sufficiently considered the specimens of all those who proclaim themselves skilled contrivers of instruments of war and that the invention and operation of the said instruments are nothing different to those in common use i shall endeavour without prejudice to any one else to explain myself to your excellency showing your lordship my secrets and then offering them to your best pleasure and approbation to work with effect at opportune moments as well as all those things which in part shall be briefly noted below i have a sort of extremely light and strong bridges adapted to be most easily carried and with them you may pursue and at any time flee from the enemy and others secure and indestructible by fire and battle easy and convenient to lift and place also methods of burning and destroying those of the enemy i know how when a place is besieged to take the water out of the trenches and make endless variety of bridges and covered ways and ladders and other machines pertaining to such expeditions item if by reason of the height of the banks or the strength of the place and its position it is impossible when besieging a place to avail oneself of the plan of bombardment i have methods for destroying every rock or other fortress even if it were founded on a rock c again i have kinds of mortars most convenient and easy to carry and with these can fling small stones almost resembling a storm and with the smoke of these causing great terror to the enemy to his great detriment and confusion and when the fight should be at sea i have kinds of many machines most efficient for offence and defence and vessels which will resist the attack of the largest guns and powder and fumes item i have means by secret and tortuous mines and ways made without noise to reach a designated spot even if it were needed to pass under a trench or a river item i will make covered chariots safe and unattackable which entering among the enemy with their artillery there is no body of men so great but they would break them and behind these infantry could follow quite unhurt and without any hindrance item in case of need i will make big guns mortars and light ordnance of fine and useful forms out of the common type where the operation of bombardment should fail i would contrive catapults mangonels trabocchi and other machines of marvellous efficacy and not in common use and in short according to the variety of cases i can contrive various and endless means of offence and defence in time of peace i believe i can give perfect satisfaction and to the equal of any other in architecture and the composition of buildings public and private and in guiding water from one place to another item i can carry out sculpture in marble bronze or clay and also in painting whatever may be done and as well as any other be he whom he may again the bronze horse may be taken in hand which is to be to the immortal glory and eternal honour of the prince your father of happy memory and of the illustrious house of sforza and if any one of the above named things seem

have had ducats and if any other comission is given me by any of the reward of my service because i am not able to be things assigned because meanwhile they have to them which they well may settle

about half of each line remains draft of letter to be sent to piacenza footnote piacenza belonged to milan the lord spoken of in this letter is no doubt lodovico il moro one may infer from the concluding sentence no l and no that leonardo who no doubt compiled this letter did not forward it to piacenza himself but gave it to some influential patron under whose name and signature a copy of it was sent to the commission magnificent commissioners of buildings i understanding that your magnificencies have made up your minds to make certain great works in bronze will remind you of certain things first that you should not be so hasty or so quick to give the commission lest by this haste it should become impossible to select a good model and a good master and some man of small merit may be chosen who by his insufficiency may cause you to be abused by your descendants judging that this age was but ill supplied with men of good counsel and with good masters seeing that other cities and chiefly the city of the florentines has been as it were in these very days endowed with beautiful and grand works in bronze among which are the doors of their baptistery and this town of florence like piacenza is a place of intercourse through which many foreigners pass who seeing that the works are fine and of good quality carry away a good impression and will say that that city is well filled with worthy inhabitants seeing the works which bear witness to their opinion and on the other hand i say seeing so much metal expended and so badly wrought it were less shame to the city if the doors had been of plain wood because the material costing so little would not seem to merit any great outlay of skill now the principal parts which are sought for in cities are their cathedrals and of these the first things which strike the eye are the doors by which one passes into these churches beware gentlemen of the commission lest too great speed in your determination and so much haste to expedite the entrusting of so great a work as that which i hear you have ordered be the cause that that which was intended for the honour of god and of men should be turned to great dishonour of your judgments and of your city which being a place of mark is the resort and gathering place of innumerable foreigners and this dishonour would result if by your lack of diligence you were to put your trust in some vaunter who by his tricks or by favour shown to him here should obtain such work from you by which lasting and very great shame would result to him and to you thus i cannot help being angry when i consider what men those are who have conferred with you as wishing to undertake this great work without thinking of their sufficiency for it not to say more this one is a potter that one a maker of cuirasses this one is a bell founder another a bell ringer and one is even a bombardier and among them one in his lordship s service who boasted that he was the gossip of messer ambrosio ferrere footnote messer ambrogio ferrere was farmer of the customs under the duke piacenza at that time belonged to milan who has some power and who has made him some promises and if this were not enough he would mount on horseback and go to his lord and obtain such letters that you could never refuse to give him the work but consider where masters of real talent and fit for such work are brought when they have to compete with such men as these open your eyes and look carefully lest your money should be spent in buying your own disgrace i can declare to you that from that place you will procure none but average works of inferior and coarse masters there is no capable man and you may believe me except leonardo the florentine who is making the equestrian statue in bronze of the duke francesco and who has no need to bring himself into notice because he has work for all his life time and i doubt whether being so great a work he will ever finish it the miserable painstakers with what hope may they expect a reward of their merit there is one whom his lordship invited from florence to do this work and who is a worthy master but with so very much business he will never finish it and you may

departure that is the possession of the twelve inches of water granted to me by the most christian king your lordship knows that i did not enter into possession because at that time when it was given to me there was a dearth of water in the canal as well by reason of the great drought as also because the outlets were not regulated but your excellency promised me that as soon as this was done i should have my rights afterwards hearing that the canal was complete i wrote several times to your lordship and to messer girolamo da cusano who has in his keeping the deed of this gift and so also i wrote to corigero and never had a reply i now send thither salai my pupil the bearer of this to whom your lordship may tell by word of mouth all that happened in the matter about which i petition your excellency i expect to go thither this easter since i am nearly at the end of my lawsuit and i will take with me two pictures of our lady which i have begun and at the present time have brought them on to a very good end nothing else occurs to me my lord the love which your excellency has always shown me and the benefits that i have constantly received from you i have hitherto i am fearful lest the small return i have made for the great benefits i have received from your excellency may not have made you somewhat annoyed with me and this is why to many letters which i have written to your

carry with me two pictures on which are two madonnas of different sizes which i began for the most christian king or for whomsoever you please i should be very glad to know where on my return from this place i shall have to reside because i do not wish to give more trouble to your lordship and then having worked for the most christian king whether my salary is to be continued or not i write to

write so much that perhaps you will become sick of it dear messer francesco i am sending thither salai to learn from his magnificence the president to what end the regulation of the water has come since at my departure this regulation of the outlets of the canal had been ordered because his magnificence the president promised me that as soon as this was done i should be satisfied it is now some time since i heard that the canal was in order as also its outlets and i immediately wrote to the president and to you and then i repeated it and never had an answer so you will have the goodness to

your excellency by reason of the wickedness of that deceiver for whom i left nothing undone which could be done for him by me and by which i might be of use to him and in the first place his allowances were paid to him before the time which i believe he would willingly deny if i had not the writing signed by myself and the interpreter and i seeing that he did not work for me unless he had no work to do for others which he was very careful in solliciting invited him to dine with me and to work afterwards near me because besides the saving of expense he footnote it is clear from the contents of this notes that they refer to leonardo s residence in rome in nor can there be any doubt that they were addressed to leonardo s patron at the time giuliano de medici third son of lorenzo the magnificent and brother of pope leo x born in he became the head of the florentine republic the pope invited him to rome where he settled in he was named patrician with much splendid ceremonial the medal struck in honour of the event bears the words mag ivlian medices leonardo too uses the style magnifico in his letter compare also no glno capponi storia della repubblica di firenze vol iii p thus describes the character of giuliano de medici who died in era il migliore della famiglia di vita placida grande spenditore tenendo intorno a se uomini ingegnosi ed ogni nuova cosa voleva provare

mensch von innerlicher richtung unbefriedigt durch das leben mitten im sonnenglanz der herrlichkeit leo s x eine dunkle gestalt die wie ein schatten voruberzog giuliano lived in the vatican and it may be safely inferred from no l and no l that leonardo did the same from the following unpublished notice in the vatican archives which m eug muntz librarian of the ecole des beaux arts paris has done me the favour to communicate to me we get a more accurate view of leonardo s relation to the often named giorgio tedesco nota delle provisione sic a da pagare per me in nome del nostro ill s bernardo bini e chompa di roma e prima della illma sua chonsorte ogni mese d a ldo da vinci per sua provisione d xxxiii e piu d vii al detto per la provisione di giorgio tedescho che sono in tutto d from this we learn that seven ducats formed the german s monthly wages but according to no l he pretended that eight ducats had been agreed upon would acquire the italian language he always promised but would never do so and this i did also because that giovanni the german who makes the mirrors was there always in the workshop and wanted to see and to know all that was being done there and made it known outside strongly criticising it and because he dined with those of the pope s guard and then they went out with guns killing birds among the ruins and this went on from after dinner till the evening and when i sent lorenzo to urge him to work he said that he would not have so many masters over him and that his work was for your excellency s wardrobe and thus two months passed and so it went on and one day finding gian niccolo of the wardrobe and asking whether the german had finished the work for your magnificence he told me this was not true but only that he had given him two guns to clean afterwards when i had urged him farther be left the workshop and began to work in his room and lost much time in making another pair of pincers and files and other tools with screws and there he worked at mills for twisting silk which he hid when any one of my people went in and with a thousand oaths and mutterings so that none of them would go there any more i was so greatly rejoiced most illustrious lord by the desired restoration of your health that my own illness almost left me but i am greatly vexed at not having been able to completely satisfy your excellency s wishes by reason of the wickedness of that german deceiver for whom i left nothing undone by which i could have hope to please him and secondly i invited him to lodge and board with me by which means i should constantly see the work he was doing and with greater ease correct his errors while besides this he would learn the italian tongue by means of which be could with more ease talk without an interpreter his moneys were always given him in advance of the time when due afterwards he wanted to have the models finished in wood just as they were to be in iron and wished to carry them away to his own country but this i refused him telling him that i would give him in drawing the breadth length height and form of what he had to do and so we remained in ill will the next thing was that he made himself another workshop and pincers and tools in his room where he slept and there he worked for others afterwards he went to dine with the swiss of the guard where there are idle fellows in which he beat them all and most times they went two or three together with guns to shoot birds among the ruins and this went on till evening at last i found how this master giovanni the mirror maker was he who had done it all for two reasons the first because he had said that my coming here had deprived him of the countenance and favour of your lordship which always the other is that he said that his iron workers rooms suited him for working at his mirrors and of this he gave proof for besides making him my enemy he made him sell all he had and leave his workshop to him where he works with a number of workmen making numerous mirrors to send to the fairs i was so greatly rejoiced most illustrious lord by the wished for recovery of your health that my own ills have almost left me and i say god be praised for it but it vexes me greatly that i have not been able completely to satisfy your excellency s wishes by reason of the wickedness of that german deceiver for whom i left nothing undone by which i could hope to please him and secondly i invited him to lodge and board with me by which means i should see constantly the work he was doing for which purpose i would have a table fixed at the foot of one of these windows where he could work with the file and finish the things made below and so i should constantly see the work he might do and it could be corrected with greater ease draft of letter written at rome this other hindered me in anatomy blaming it before the pope and likewise at the hospital and he has filled this whole belvedere with workshops for mirrors and he did the same thing in maestro giorgio s room he said that he had been promised eight ducats every month beginning with the first day when he set out or at latest when he spoke with you and that you agreed seeing that he seldom stayed in the workshop and that he ate a great deal i sent him word that if he liked i could deal with him separately for each thing that he might make and would give him what we might agree to be a fair valuation he took counsel with his neighbour and gave up his room selling every thing and went to find miscellaneous records footnote a puzzling passage meant as it would seem for a jest compare the description of giants in dante inf xxi and xxii perhaps leonardo had the giant antaeus in his mind of him the myth relates that he was a son of ge that he fed on lions that he hunted in libya and killed the inhabitants he enjoyed the peculiarity of renewing his strength whenever he fell and came in contact with his mother earth but that hercules lifted him up and so conquered and strangled him lucan gives a full account of the struggle pharsalia iv the reading of this passage which is very indistinctly written is in many places doubtful dear benedetto de pertarti when the proud giant fell because of the bloody and miry state of the ground it was as though a mountain had fallen so that the country shook as with an earthquake and terror fell on pluto in hell from the violence of the shock he lay as stunned on the level ground suddenly the people seeing him as one killed by a thunderbolt turned back like ants running wildly over the body of the fallen oak so these rushing over his ample limbs them with frequent wounds by which the giant being roused and feeling himself almost covered by the multitude he suddenly perceives the smarting of the stabs and sent forth a roar which sounded like a terrific clap of thunder and placing his hands on the ground he raised his terrible face and having lifted one hand to his head he found it full of men and rabble sticking to it like the minute creatures which not unfrequently are found there wherefore with a shake of his head he sends the men flying through the air just as hail does when driven by the fury of the winds many of these men were found to be dead stamping with his feet and clinging to his hair and striving to hide in it they behaved like sailors in a storm who run up the ropes to lessen the force of the wind by taking in sail news of things from the east be it known to you that in the month of june there appeared a giant who came from the lybian desert mad with rage like ants struck down by the rude this great giant was born in mount atlas and was a hero and had to fight against the egyptians and arabs medes and persians he lived in the sea on whales grampuses and ships mars fearing for his life took refuge under the of jove and at the great fall it seemed as though the whole province quaked this spirit returns to the brain whence it had departed with a loud voice and with these words it moved and if any man though he may have wisdom or goodness footnote this passage very difficult to decipher is on the reverse of a drawing at windsor pl cxxii which possibly has some connection with it the drawing is slightly reduced in this reproduction the original being cm high by cm wide o blessed and happy spirit whence comest thou well have i known this man much against my will this one is a receptacle of villainy he is a perfect heap of the utmost ingratitude combined with every vice but of what use is it to fatigue myself with vain words nothing is to be found in them but every form of sin and if there should be found among them any that possesses any good they will not be treated differently to myself by other men and in fine i come to the conclusion that it is bad if they are hostile and worse if they are friendly miscellaneous drafts of letters and personal records all the ills that are or ever were if they could be set to work by him would not satisfy the desires of his iniquitous soul and i could not in any length of time describe his nature to you but i conclude i know one who having promised me much less than my due being disappointed of his presumptuous desires has tried to deprive me of all my friends and as he has found them wise and not pliable to his will he has menaced me that having found means of denouncing me he would deprive me of my benefactors hence i have informed your lordship of this to the end that this man who wishes to sow the usual scandals may find no soil fit for sowing the thoughts and deeds of his evil nature so that he trying to make your lordship the instrument of his iniquitous and maliceous nature may be disappointed of his desire footnote below this text we read gusstino giustino and in another passage on the same page justin is quoted no the two have however no real connection and in this case i know that i shall make few enemies seeing that no one will believe what i can say of him for they are but few whom his vices have disgusted and he only dislikes those men whose natures are contrary to those vices and many hate their fathers and break off friendship with those who reprove their vices and he will not permit any examples against them nor any advice if you meet with any one who is virtuous do not drive him from you do him honour so that he may not have to flee from you and be reduced to hiding in hermitages or caves or other solitary places to escape from your treachery if there is such an one among you do him honour for these are our saints upon earth these are they who deserve statues from us and images but remember that their images are not to be eaten by you as is still done in some parts of india footnote in explanation of this passage i have received the following communication from dr g w leitner of lahore so far as indian customs are known to us this practice spoken of by leonardo as still existing in some parts of india is perfectly unknown and it is equally opposed to the spirit of hinduism mohammedanism and sikhism in central thibet the ashes of the dead when burnt are mixed with dough and small figures usually of buddha are stamped out of them and some are laid in the grave while others are distributed among the relations the custom spoken of by leonardo may have prevailed there but i never heard of it possibly leonardo refers here to customs of nations of america where when the images have according to them performed some miracle the priests cut them in pieces being of wood and give them to all the people of the country not without payment and each one grates his portion very fine and puts it upon the first food he eats and thus believes that by faith he has eaten his saint who then preserves him from all perils what do you think here man of your

the mss can have been for the most part intelligible to the writer only in many cases their meaning and connection are all the more obscure because we are in ignorance about the persons with whom leonardo used to converse nor can we say what part he may have played in the various events of his time vasari and other early biographers give us a very superficial and far from accurate picture of leonardo s private life though his own memoranda referring for the most part to incidents of no permanent interest do not go far towards supplying this deficiency they are nevertheless of some importance and interest as helping us to solve the numerous mysteries in which the history of leonardo s long life remains involved we may at any rate assume from leonardo s having committed to paper notes on more or less trivial matters on his pupils on his house keeping on various known and unknown personages and a hundred other trifies that at the time they must have been in some way important to him i have endeavoured to make these miscellaneous notes as complete as possible for in many cases an incidental memorandum will help to explain the meaning of some other note of a similar kind the first portion of these notes nos l l as well as those referring to his pupils and to other artists and artificers who lived in his house are arranged in chronological order a considerable proportion of these notes belong to the period between and when leonardo was living at milan under the patronage of lodovico il moro a time concerning which we have otherwise only very scanty information if leonardo did really as has always been supposed spend also the greater part of the preceding decade in milan it seems hardly likely that we should not find a single note indicative of the fact or referring to any event of that period on the numerous loose leaves in his writing that exist leonardo s life in milan between and must have been comparatively uneventful the mss and memoranda of those years seem to prove that it was a tranquil period of intellectual and artistic labour rather than of bustling court life whatever may have been the fate of the mss and note books of the foregoing years whether they were destroyed by leonardo himself or have been lost it is certainly strange that nothing whatever exists to inform us as to his life and doings in milan earlier than the consecutive series of manuscripts which begin in the year there is nothing surprising in the fact that the notes regarding his pupils are few and meagre excepting for the record of money transactions only very exceptional circumstances would have prompted him to make any written observations on the persons with whom he was in daily intercourse among whom of course were his pupils of them all none is so frequently mentioned as salai but the character of the notes does not as it seems to me justify us in supposing that he was any thing more than a sort of factotum of leonardo s see note leonardo s quotations from books and his lists of titles supply nothing more than a hint as to his occasional literary studies or recreations it was evidently no part of his ambition to be deeply read see nrs and he more than once expressly states in various passages which will be found in the foregoing sections that he did not recognise the authority of the ancients on scientific questions which in his day was held paramount archimedes is the sole exception and leonardo frankly owns his admiration for the illustrious greek to whose genius his own was so much akin see no all his notes on various authors excepting those which have already been inserted in the previous section have been arranged alphabetically for the sake of convenience the passages next in order contain accounts and inventories principally of household property the publication of these often very trivial entries is only justifiable as proving that the wealth the splendid mode of life and lavish expenditure which have been attributed to leonardo are altogether mythical unless we put forward the very improbable hypothesis that these notes as to money in hand outlay and receipts refer throughout to an exceptional state of his affairs viz when he was short of money the memoranda collected at the end no are in the original in the usual writing from left to right besides the style of the handwriting is at variance with what we should expect it to be if really leonardo himself had written these notes most of them are to be found in juxtaposition with undoubtedly authentic writing of his but this may be easily explained if we take into account the fact that leonardo frequently wrote on loose sheets he may therefore have occasionally used paper on which others had made short memoranda for the most part as it would seem for his use at the end of all i have given leonardo s will from the copy of it preserved in the melzi library it has already been printed by amoretti and by uzielli it is not known what has become of the original document memoranda before l find longhi and tell him that you wait for him at rome and will go with him to naples make you pay the donation footnote libro di

distinctly written in line ingol amor a ilopan a and on line enoiganod al are obviously in cipher and the solution is a simple one by reading them backwards we find for ingol logni probably longi evidently the name of a person for amor a a roma for ilopan a a napoli leonardo has done the same in two passages treating on some secrets of his art nos and the only other places in which we find this cipher employed we may therefore conclude that it was for the sake of secrecy that he used it there can be no doubt from the tenor of this passage that leonardo projected a secret excursion to naples nothing has hitherto been known of this journey but the significance of the passage will be easily understood by a reference to the following notes from which we may infer that leonardo really had at the time plans for travelling further than naples from lines and it is evident that he purposed after selling every thing that was not easily portable to leave a chest in the care of his relations at vinci his luggage was to be packed into two trunks especially adapted for transport by mules the exact meaning of many sentences in the following notes must necessarily remain obscure

battista and frontinus on acqueducts footnote vitruvius de arch et frontinus de aquedoctibus florence this is the earliest edition of frontinus the note referring to this author thus suggests a solution of the problem of the date of the leicester manuscript footnote compare no anaxagoras every thing proceeds from every thing and every thing becomes every thing and every thing can be turned into every thing else because that which exists in the elements is composed of those elements the archimedes belonging to the bishop of padua footnote see no and vol i no archimedes gave the quadrature of a polygonal figure but not of the circle hence archimedes never squared any figure with curved sides he squared the circle minus the smallest portion that the intellect can conceive that is the smallest point visible footnote compare no if any man could have discovered the utmost powers of the cannon in all its various forms and have given such a secret to the romans with what rapidity would they have conquered every country and have vanquished every army and what reward could have been great enough for such a service archimedes indeed although he had greatly damaged the romans in the siege of syracuse nevertheless did not fail of being offered great rewards from these very romans and when syracuse was taken diligent search was made for archimedes and he being found dead greater lamentation was made for him by the senate and people of rome than if they had lost all their army and they did not fail to honour him with burial and with a statue at their head was marcus marcellus and after the second destruction of syracuse the sepulchre of archimedes was found again by cato in the ruins of a temple so cato had the temple restored and the sepulchre he so highly honoured whence it is written that cato said that he was not so proud of any thing he had done as of having paid such honour to archimedes footnote where leonardo found the statement that cato had found and restored the tomb of archimedes i do not know it is a merit that cicero claims as his own tusc v and certainly with a full right to it none of archimedes biographers not even the diligent mazzucchelli mentions any version in which cato is named it is evidently a slip of the memory on leonardo s part besides according to the passage in cicero the grave was not found nelle ruine

were not published before leonardo s death cornelius celsus the highest good is wisdom the chief evil is suffering in the body because as we are composed of two things that is soul and body of which the first is the better the body is the inferior wisdom belongs to the better part and the chief evil belongs to the worse part and is the worst of all as the best thing of all in the soul is wisdom so the worst in the body is suffering therefore just as bodily pain is the chief evil wisdom is the chief good of the soul that is with the wise man and nothing else can be compared with it footnote aulus cornelius celsus a roman physician known as the roman hippocrates probably contemporary with augustus only his eight books de medicina are preserved the earliest editions are cornelius celsus de medicina libr viii milan venice and demetrius was wont to say that there was no difference between the speech and words of the foolish and ignorant and the noises and rumblings of the wind in an inflated stomach nor did he say so without reason for he saw no difference between the parts whence the noise issued whether their lower parts or their mouth since one and the other were of equal use

lesser magnitude and by the second the greater is defined a part is spoken of in relation to the whole and all their relations lie between these two extremes and are called multiples hippocrates says that the origin of men s sperm derives from the brain and from the lungs and testicles of our parents where the final decocture is made and all the other limbs transmit their substance to this sperm by means of expiration because there are no channels through which they might come to the sperm footnote the works of hippocrates were printed first after leonardo s death lucretius in his third book

about at verona in at brescia in at venice in and in and at florence in the numbers and noted by leonardo at the end of the two passages seem to indicate pages but if so none of the editions just mentioned can here be meant nor do these numbers refer to the verses in the poems of lucretius ammianus marcellinus asserts that seven hundred thousand volumes of books were burnt in the siege of alexandria in the time of julius cesar footnote ammiani marcellini historiarum libri qui extant xiii published at rome in mondino says that the muscles which raise the toes are in the outward side of

of ecliderides king of the cirodastri and in maritime warfare he ordered that the ships should have tall masts and that on their tops there should be a spar fixed footnote compare no of feet long and one third of a foot thick at one end of this was a small grappling iron and at the other a counterpoise and there was also attached feet of chain and at the end of this chain as much rope as would reach from the chain to the base of the top where it was fixed with a small rope from this base it ran down to the bottom of the mast where a very strong spar was attached and to this was fastened the end of the rope but to go on to the use of his machine i say that below this grappling iron was a fire footnote compare no which with tremendous noise threw down its rays and a shower of burning pitch which pouring down on the enemy s top compelled the men who were in it to abandon the top to which the grappling iron had clung this was hooked on to the edges of the top and then suddenly the cord

s greek grammar messer vincenzio aliprando who lives near the inn of the bear has giacomo andrea s vitruvius vitruvius says that small models are of no avail for ascertaining the effects of large ones and i here propose to prove that this conclusion is a false one and chiefly by bringing forward the very same argument which led him to this conclusion that is by an experiment with an auger for he proves that if a man by a certain exertion of strength makes a hole of a given diameter and afterwards another hole of double the diameter this cannot be made with only double the exertion of the man s strength but needs much more to this it may very well be answered that an auger of double the diameter cannot be moved by double the exertion be cause the superficies of a body of the same form but twice as large has four times the extent of the superficies of the smaller as is shown in the two figures a and n of squaring the circle and who it was that first discovered it by accident vitruvius measuring miles by means of the repeated revolutions of the wheels which move vehicles extended over many stadia the lines of the circumferences of the circles of these wheels he became aware of them by the animals that moved the vehicles but he did not discern that this was a means of finding a square equal to a circle this was first done by archimedes of syracuse who by multiplying the second diameter of a circle by half its circumference produced a rectangular quadrilateral equal figure to the circle footnote compare no footnote vitruvius see also nos and virgil says that a blank shield

nos and stand in close connection with each other but the meaning of some words is very doubtful and a translation is thus rendered impossible footnote greek characters canonica of on the th of july my dearly beloved mother sisters and cousin i herewith inform you that thanks to god i am about the sword which i bring it to maso at the piazza and i will settle the business of piero so that footnote amoretti mem stor xxiv quotes the first three lines of this letter as by leonardo the character of the writing however does not favour this hypothesis and still less the contents i should regard it rather a rough draft of a letter by young melzi i have not succeeded in deciphering completely the lines of this text amoretti reads at the beginning canonica di vaprio but vaprio seems to me a very doubtful reading ut bene respondet naturae ars docta dedisset vincius ut tribuit cetera sic animam noluit ut similis magis haec foret altera sic est possidet illius maurus amans animam footnote these three epigrams on the portrait of lucrezia crivelli a picture by leonardo which must have been lost at a very early date seem to have been dedicated to leonardo by the poet leonardo used the reverse of the sheet for notes on geometry hujus quam cernis nomen lucretia divi omnia cui larga contribuere manu rara huic forma data est pinxit leonardos amavit maurus pictorum primus hic ille ducum naturam ac superas hac laesit imagine divas pictor tantum hominis posse manum haec doluit illae longa dari tam magnae tempera formae quae spatio fuerat deperitura brevi egidius romanus on

pour amboyse he says too that this address is of the year and mr ravaisson remarks de cette suscription il semble qu on peut inferer que leonard etait alors en france a la cour de louis xii pour conclure je crois qu il n est pas prouve que leonard de vinci n ait pas fait un voyage de quelques mois en france sous louis xii entre le printemps de et l automne de i must confess that i myself have not succeeded in deciphering completely this french writing of which two words remain to me doubtful but so much seems to be quite evident that this is not an address of a letter at all but a certificate or note amboise l i believe to be the signature of charles d amboise the governor of milan if this explanation is the right one it can be easily explained by the contents of nos and the note line was perhaps added later by another hand and leonardo himself wrote afterwards on the same sheet some geometrical explanations i must also point out that the statement that this sheet belongs to the year has absolutely no foundation in fact there is no clue whatever for giving a precise date to this note to monsieur le vinci the horses of the king s equerry continue the payment to ms lyonard painter to the king amboise footnote greek characters memorandum to maestro lionardo to have the state of florence to remind your excellency that ridolfo manini brought to florence a quantity
